"%X The postservice mortality (through December 1983) of a cohort of 9324 US Army veterans who served in Vietnam was compared with that of 8989 Vietnam-era Army veterans who served in Korea, Germany, or the United States. Over the entire follow-up period, total mortality in Vietnam veterans was 17% higher than for other veterans. The excess mortality occurred mainly in the first five years after discharge from active duty (rate ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.96) and involved motor vehicle accidents, suicide, homicide, and accidental poisonings. Thereafter, mortality among Vietnam veterans was similar to that of other Vietnam-era veterans, except for drug-related deaths, which continued to be elevated. An unexpected finding was a deficit in deaths from diseases of the circulatory system among Vietnam veterans. The excess in postservice mortality due to external causes among Vietnam veterans is similar to that found among men returning from combat areas after World War II and the Korean War."

"%X Identification of risk and protective factors for suicide is a priority for the United States military, especially in light of the recent steady increase in military suicide rates. The Department of Defense Suicide Event Report contains comprehensive data on suicides for active duty military personnel, but no analogous control data is available to permit identification of factors that differentially determine suicide risk. This proof-of-concept study was conducted to determine the feasibility of collecting such control data. The study employed a prospective case-control design in which control cases were randomly selected from a large Army installation at a rate of four control participants for every qualifying Army suicide. Although 111 Army suicides were confirmed during the study period, just 27 control soldiers completed the study. Despite the small control sample, preliminary analyses comparing suicide cases to controls identified several factors more frequently reported for suicide cases, including recent failed intimate relationships, outpatient mental health history, mood disorder diagnosis, substance abuse history, and prior self-injury. No deployment-related risk factors were found. These data are consistent with existing literature and form a foundation for larger control studies. Methodological lessons learned regarding study design and recruitment are discussed to inform future studies."

"%X This paper focuses on how mental health professionals working with Army commanders can help them make decisions based on valid population-based metrics. We first summarize the scope of the impact of suicides on the Army. We then describe the process by which decision-making can be optimized.|The currently available tools in the US Army including BH Pulse, Unit Risk Inventory, The Azimuth Check, and the Army Readiness Assessment Program have a role in assisting mental health professionals. The specific advantages of BH Pulse over the other tools are highlighted. The US Army has been committed to enhancing its suicide prevention program through comprehensive policies, procedures, and provisions of resources. Commanders are expected to interact with the suicide prevention programs in their units and maximize the systems in place to prevent suicides and other negative mental health outcomes. Commanders are expected to receive cues and signals from a variety of data sources to assist their decision-making process. We discuss the specific advantages of BH Pulse and recommend its routine use for primary prevention and utilizing this tool after incidents to make data-driven, justifiable decisions. Finally, recommendations are provided on enhancing a unit's suicide prevention program."

"%X Stigma towards mental illness represents a significant challenge. No specific anti-stigma military training curricula currently exists. An infantry division sought to reduce stigma by inviting 2 guest speakers to address Soldiers. The intervention was designed on social contact theory and executed as a quality improvement project. The intervention was speakers self-disclosing their own mental health struggles and having the audience contact with persons from the stigmatized group. Postintervention evaluation (N=361) demonstrated significant reduction in stigma scores (t=8.128, df=329, P<.001, 2-tailed, d=0.3), and effect size was greatest (d=1.17) among those with greater baseline stigma scores. Soldiers also reported positive perceptions of help-seeking behaviors. Given these findings, other units could conduct these type of training events to target stigma toward mental illness."

"%X Suicides among active duty US Army personnel have been increasing since 2004, surpassing comparable civilian rates in 2008. This analysis uses US military data to assess suicide rates for the 2-year period 2007--8, and examines relative risks (RR) of suicide associated with mental health disorders.|Historical trends of US Army suicides were assessed using 1977--2008 data from Army G-1 (Personnel). Suicide rates, RR and the 2000--8 trends of mental health disorders were calculated using data from the Defense Casualty Information Processing System and Defense Medical Surveillance System.|A total of 255 soldiers committed suicide in 2007--8 (2008 rate 20.2 per 100‰Ûö000). Factors associated with higher suicide risk included male gender, lower enlisted rank and mental health disorders treated on an outpatient basis (RR 3.9), as well as a number of mental health disorders (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality/psychotic disorders, substance-related disorders and adjustment disorder; RR range 4.7--24.5). Analysis of historical trends suggested that 25--50% of the suicides that occurred in 2008 might have been related to the major commitment of troops to combat beginning in 2003.|The recent increase in suicides parallels an increase in the prevalence of mental disorders across the army. This finding suggests that increasing rates of clinically treated psychopathology are associated with increasing rates of suicides; these rates probably serve as sentinels for suicide risk in this population. Soldiers seeking treatment for mental disorders and substance abuse should be a focus for suicide prevention."

The present study explores how psychological hardiness, avoidance coping, and combat stress exposure may influence depression in U.S. Army soldiers returning from a one-year deployment to Afghanistan.|National Guard soldiers (NåÊ=åÊ357) completed surveys upon their return to home station, including measures of hardiness, avoidance coping, combat exposure, and depression. Path analysis with ordinary least squares regression procedures (PROCESS program; Hayes, 2013) were applied to test for mediation and moderation effects among the study variables.|Results showed a pattern of moderated-mediation. In the mediation model, hardiness had a significant effect on depression, which was mediated by avoidance coping. Soldiers low in hardiness reported using more avoidance coping strategies, which was related to increased depression. This effect in turn was seen to be conditional, moderated by level of combat exposure such that the effect was stronger at high levels of exposure.|Data are cross-sectional, and the sample consisted of male soldiers only, which may limit generalizability.|Depression and related problems among combat veterans may be diminished by applying training programs and policies aimed at increasing hardiness attitudes and active coping skills."

"%X Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death for Americans in 2015 and rates have been steadily climbing over the last 25 years. Rates are particularly high amongst U.S. military personnel. Suicide prevention efforts in the military are significantly hampered by the lack of: (1) assessment tools for measuring baseline risk and (2) methods to detect periods of particularly heightened risk. Two specific barriers to assessing suicide risk in military personnel that call for innovation are: (1) the geographic dispersion of military personnel from healthcare settings, particularly amongst components like the Reserves; and (2) professional and social disincentives to acknowledging psychological distress. The primary aim of this paper is to describe recent technological developments that could contribute to risk assessment tools that are not subject to the limitations mentioned above. More specifically, Behavioral Signal Processing can be used to assess behaviors during interaction and conversation that likely indicate increased risk for suicide, and computer-administered, cognitive performance tasks can be used to assess activation of the suicidal mode. These novel methods can be used remotely and do not require direct disclosure or endorsement of psychological distress, solving two challenges to suicide risk assessment in military and other sensitive settings. We present an introduction to these technologies, describe how they can specifically be applied to assessing behavioral and cognitive risk for suicide, and close with recommendations for future research."

"%X Suicides among U.S. Army soldiers are increasing and, in January 2009, outpaced deaths due to combat. For this study, 1,873 army suicides identified through death, inpatient, and emergency room records were matched with 5,619 controls. In multivariate models, older, male, White, single, and enlisted soldiers with a prior injury (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.64-2.54), alcohol (OR = 3.41, 95% CI = 2.32-4.99), or mental health hospitalization (OR = 6.62, 95% CI = 4.77-9.20) were at increased risk for suicide. Risk was greatest immediately following diagnoses, but remained elevated even after 5 or more years of follow-up. Most injury hospitalizations were unintentional but, nonetheless, significantly associated with suicide. Interactions indicate soldiers with both mental health and injury history are particularly vulnerable."

The DNBI casualty rate for the BCT was 257.0/1,000 soldier combat-years. Females, compared with males, had a significantly increased incidence rate ratio for becoming a DNBI casualty 1.67 (95% CI 1.37, 2.04). Of 47 female soldiers receiving MEDEVAC 35 (74%) were for pregnancy-related issues. Musculoskeletal injuries (50.4%) and psychiatric disorders (23.3%) were the most common body systems involved with DNBI casualties. Among the BCT cohort the psychiatric DNBI casualty rate and suicide rate were 59.8 and 0.58 per 1,000 soldier combat-years. The BCT cohort incidence rates for common musculoskeletal injuries per 1,000 combat-years were as follows: ankle sprain 15.3, anterior cruciate ligament rupture 3.3 and shoulder dislocation 1.2.|Musculoskeletal injuries and psychiatric disorders accounted for 74% of the total DNBI casualties, and 43% of the DNBI casualties requiring subsequent MEDEVAC. The BCT cohort had a suicide rate nearly four times greater than previously reported, and selected musculoskeletal injury incidence rates were fivefold greater than the general population."

"%X Research suggests that exposure to psychologic trauma is associated with mortality from external causes, including homicide, suicide, drug overdoses, and unintended injury. However, the etiology of this association is unclear. We examined the survival time and cause of death among a national sample of 15288 US Army veterans by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status 30 years after military service. In these analyses, we included demographic (age, race, marital status, service entry age, and birthplace), predisposing (army volunteer status, discharge status, history of drug abuse, early-age alcohol use, and intelligence), and combat exposure variables. After adjusting for demographic and predisposing factors, all-cause mortality was associated with PTSD for all veterans combined (hazards ratio [HR] = 2.1, P < .001), as well as for era veterans without Vietnam service (HR = 2.0, P = .001) and theater veterans with Vietnam service (HR = 2.1, P < .001). For theater veterans, PTSD remained significant for all-cause mortality, even after controlling for demographic, predisposition, and combat exposure measures (HR = 2.1, P < .001). For external mortality, the adjusted results indicated that PTSD was associated with death for all veterans combined (HR = 2.3, P < .001) and for theater veterans separately (HR = 2.2, P = .002). For era veterans, the adjusted external mortality results also approached statistical significance (HR = 2.2, P = .068). Among theater veterans, PTSD remained significant for external mortality, even after controlling for all variables and combat exposure (HR = 2.2, P = .002). Combat exposure was not associated with external mortality once all variables were controlled. In addition, theater veterans who volunteered for Vietnam and those with dishonorable discharges were at increased risk for external-cause mortality."

"%X To determine whether group cognitive processing therapy-cognitive only version (CPT-C) is associated with iatrogenic suicide risk in a sample of active duty US Army personnel diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Possible iatrogenic effects considered include the incidence and severity of suicide ideation, worsening of preexisting suicide ideation, incidence of new-onset suicide ideation, and incidence of suicide attempts among soldiers receiving group CPT-C. Comparison with group present-centered therapy (PCT) was made to contextualize findings.|One hundredåÊeight soldiers (100 men, eight women) diagnosed with PTSD were randomized to receive either group CPT-C or group PCT. PTSD diagnosis was confirmed via structured clinician interview. Suicide ideation, depression severity, and PTSD severity were assessed at pretreatment, weekly during treatment, and 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months posttreatment.|Rates of suicide ideation significantly decreased across both treatments. Among soldiers with pretreatment suicide ideation, severity of suicide ideation significantly decreased across both treatments and was maintained for up to 12 months posttreatment. Exacerbation of preexisting suicide ideation was uncommon in both treatments. New-onset suicide ideation was rare and similar across both treatments (<16%). There were no suicide attempts during treatment or follow-up in either group. Change in depression symptoms predicted change in suicide risk.|Suicide-related outcomes were similar across both treatments and primarily associated with comorbid depression. Suicide-related outcomes in group CPT-C were rare and comparable to patterns observed in an active, nontrauma-focused therapy, even among soldiers who entered treatment with suicide ideation.|NCT01286415, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01286415."

"%X Previous research supports the efficacy of the crisis response plan (CRP) for the reduction of suicidal behaviors as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Patient perspectives and use of the CRP, and their relationship to later suicidal thoughts, remain unknown.|A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing a standard CRP (S-CRP), a CRP enhanced with reasons for living (E-CRP), and TAU in a sample of 97 active-duty U.S. Army personnel was conducted. Participants were asked about their use, perceptions, and recall of each intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the conditional effects of intervention use, perceptions, and recall on severity of suicide ideation during follow-up.|Across all treatment groups, over 80% of participants retained their written CRP up to 6 months later, but less than 25% had the written plan in their physical possession at the time of each assessment. Participants in S-CRP and E-CRP were more likely to recall self-management strategies and sources of social support. Participants in TAU were more likely to recall use of professional healthcare services and crisis management services. All three interventions were rated as highly useful. More frequent use of the E-CRP and recall of its components were associated with significantly reduced suicide ideation as compared to TAU.|Both CRPs have high acceptability ratings. The effect of both CRPs on reduced suicide ideation is associated with patient recall of components. More frequent use of the E-CRP is associated with larger reductions in suicide ideation."

"%X Prior studies have documented associations of childhood bullying victimization with suicidal behaviors. However, many failed to adjust for concomitant risk factors and none investigated this relationship in military personnel. This study aimed to estimate independent associations of childhood bullying victimization with suicidal behaviors among U.S. Army soldiers.|Soldiers reporting for basic training completed a cross-sectional survey assessing mental disorders, suicidal behaviors, and childhood adversities including two types of bullying victimization: (1) Physical Assault/Theft and (2) Bullying Comments/Behaviors. Associations of childhood bullying experiences with suicidal behaviors were estimated using discrete-time survival analysis of person-year data from 30,436 soldiers. Models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, childhood maltreatment by adults, and mental disorders.|After comprehensive adjustment for other risk factors, more frequent Physical Assault/Theft by peers during childhood was associated with increased odds of lifetime suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.26, P < .001) and attempt (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13-1.50, P < .001). More frequent Bullying Comments/Behaviors were associated with increased risk of ideation (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26-1.35, P < .001), plan (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.35-1.54, P < .001), attempt (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15-1.33, P < .001), and onset of plan among ideators (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.15, P = .002). Relative to no bullying victimization, exposure to the most persistent bullying was associated with two- to fourfold increase in risk for suicidal behaviors.|Childhood bullying victimization is associated with lifetime suicidal behaviors among new soldiers. Exposure to Bullying Comments/Behaviors during childhood is associated with progression from suicidal ideation to plan. Improved recognition of these relationships may inform risk mitigation interventions for soldiers."

"%X To estimate associations of lifetime traumatic brain injury (TBI) characteristics with prospective suicide attempt among US Army soldiers.|The Army STARRS (Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers) Pre/Post Deployment Study surveyed 3 Brigade Combat Teams that were deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Lifetime TBI and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were evaluated at predeployment baseline. Recency and number of TBIs were quantified, and TBI severity was classified on the basis of reports of alteration/loss of consciousness and memory lapse. Suicide attempt data came from administrative records and surveys administered after return from deployment. Logistic regression models estimated associations of TBI characteristics with prospective suicide attempt among baseline respondents who were deployed (n = 7677), adjusting for other risk factors including lifetime mental disorder.|One hundred three soldiers made a suicide attempt over a median follow-up period of 30 months (weighted prevalence = 1.31% [0.14%]). In the final model estimating joint associations of TBI severity/recency and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms, only postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were associated with a higher risk of suicide attempt (per standard score increase: AOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = .012).|Among the lifetime TBI characteristics evaluated at predeployment baseline, only past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were prospectively associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt following deployment. Detection of postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms could facilitate targeting of Army suicide prevention programs."

"%X To estimate associations of lifetime traumatic brain injury (TBI) characteristics with prospective suicide attempt among US Army soldiers.|The Army STARRS (Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers) Pre/Post Deployment Study surveyed 3 Brigade Combat Teams that were deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Lifetime TBI and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were evaluated at predeployment baseline. Recency and number of TBIs were quantified, and TBI severity was classified on the basis of reports of alteration/loss of consciousness and memory lapse. Suicide attempt data came from administrative records and surveys administered after return from deployment. Logistic regression models estimated associations of TBI characteristics with prospective suicide attempt among baseline respondents who were deployed (n = 7677), adjusting for other risk factors including lifetime mental disorder.|One hundred three soldiers made a suicide attempt over a median follow-up period of 30 months (weighted prevalence = 1.31% [0.14%]). In the final model estimating joint associations of TBI severity/recency and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms, only postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were associated with a higher risk of suicide attempt (per standard score increase: AOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = .012).|Among the lifetime TBI characteristics evaluated at predeployment baseline, only past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were prospectively associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt following deployment. Detection of postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms could facilitate targeting of Army suicide prevention programs."

"%X Workplace bullying is associated with mental disorders and suicidality in civilians, but few studies have examined associations of bullying with these outcomes among military personnel.|To evaluate associations of being bullied or hazed during deployment with major depressive disorder (MDD), intermittent explosive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and substance use disorder (SUD).|This cohort study used data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) New Soldier Study (NSS; April 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012) and wave 1 of the STARRS Longitudinal Study (STARRS-LS1; September 1, 2016, to April 30, 2018). A computerized survey administered at 3 US Army installations (NSS) and a web/telephone survey (STARRS-LS1) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed from October 11, 2021, to October 28, 2022. The STARRS-LS1 recruited a probability sample of active-duty soldiers and veterans who had participated in Army STARRS baseline surveys while on active duty (weighted response rate, 35.6%). Respondents whose baseline was the NSS and who had deployed to a combat theater at least once were eligible for this study.|Being bullied or hazed during a combat deployment.|The primary outcomes were MDD, intermittent explosive disorder, PTSD, and suicidal ideation in the 12 months before STARRS-LS1 and SUD in the 30 days before STARRS-LS1, assessed with items from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales, PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations of bullying or hazing exposure with the outcomes.|The 1463 participants were predominantly male (weighted percentage [SE], 90.4% [0.9%]) and had a mean (SE) age of 21.1 (0.1) years at baseline. At STARRS-LS1, 188 respondents (weighted percentage [SE], 12.2% [1.1%]) reported bullying or hazing during deployment. Weighted outcome prevalences were 18.7% (1.3%) for MDD, 5.2% (0.9%) for intermittent explosive disorder, 21.8% (1.5%) for PTSD, 14.2% (1.2%) for suicidal ideation, and 8.7% (1.0%) for SUD. In models that adjusted for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and other potential traumas, exposure to bullying or hazing was significantly associated with MDD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.92; 95% CI, 1.74-4.88), intermittent explosive disorder (aOR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.20-5.59), PTSD (aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.23-2.83), suicidal ideation (aOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17-3.13), and SUD (aOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.15-3.70).|In this cohort study of combat-deployed soldiers, reports of being bullied or hazed during deployment were associated with mental disorders and suicidal thoughts. Recognition of these associations may inform efforts to prevent and address mental health problems among service members."

"%X There have been studies about the impact of a suicide on family members and friends, but none to date on a military unit in a combat zone. This is the first description, to my knowledge, of the effects of the suicide of a U.S. Army soldier deployed to Iraq. A narrative from the treating psychiatrist's perspective describes both the acute and longer-term (four months) effects of the suicide on members of the soldier's unit, other soldiers at the same base, members of the medical team who attempted to resuscitate him, and mental health care providers. This account describes how the suicide affected at least thirteen other soldiers on the base. The effects of the soldier's suicide showed a few similarities to those described in the literature, including stigmatization of the survivors and the stress experienced by the mental health providers. There were additional repercussions that have not been previously described, including the impact on the soldier's peers within his unit and other soldiers on the base, the need for medical evacuation from Iraq of soldiers following the event, and the reported stress on the medical staff due to the attempted resuscitation of someone known to them. Future research is needed to understand the impact of a suicide on the survivors in a deployed military setting and to establish best practices for postvention strategies."

"%X The Secretary of the U.S. Army issued two directives in late 2017 to directly combat the problem of suicide in the U.S. Army. The first was to develop an Army tool to assist commanders and first-line leaders in preventing suicide and improving behavioral health (BH) outcomes, which has been previously published as the BH Readiness and Risk Reduction Review (R4). The second was to conduct an evaluation study of the tool with Army units in the field. This study is the first to empirically examine the Army's tool-based methods for identifying and caring for the health and welfare of soldiers at risk for suicide, and this article outlines the methodology employed to study the effectiveness of the R4 tools and accomplish the Secretary's second directive.|The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Institutional Review Board approved the R4 study. The study employed a repeated measurements in pre/post quasi-experimental design, including a nonequivalent but comparable business-as-usual control group. The R4 intervention consisted of the R4 tools, accompanying instructions, and an orientation. Samples were drawn from two geographically separated U.S. Army divisions in the continental United States, each composed of four comparable brigades. Study implementation consisted of three phases and three data collections over the course of 12 months. Soldiers completed anonymous survey instruments to assess a range of health factors, behaviors, characteristics, tool-related decision-making processes, and the frequency, type, and quality of interactions between soldiers and leaders.|The R4 study commenced on May 6, 2019, and concluded on June 4, 2020. Sample size goals were achieved for both the divisions at all three data collection time points.|The methodology of the R4 study is critical for the U.S. Army from both a precedential and an outcome-based standpoint. Despite the use of many previous tools and programs for suicide prevention, this is the first time the Army has been able to empirically test the effectiveness of tool-supported decision-making among Army units in a rigorous fashion. The methodology of such a test is a critical marker for future interventional inquiries on the subject of suicide in the Army, and the results will allow for more informed decision-making by leaders when approaching these ongoing challenges."

"%X Although numerous efforts have aimed to reduce suicides in the U.S. Army, completion rates have remained elevated. Army leaders play an important role in supporting soldiers at risk of suicide, but existing suicide-prevention tools tailored to leaders are limited and not empirically validated. The purpose of this article is to describe the process used to develop the Behavioral Health Readiness and Suicide Risk Reduction Review (R4) tools for Army leaders that are currently undergoing empirical validation with two U.S. Army divisions.|Consistent with a Secretary of the Army directive, approximately 76 interviews and focus groups were conducted with Army leaders and subject matter experts (SMEs) to obtain feedback regarding existing practices for suicide risk management, leader tools, and institutional considerations. In addition, reviews of the empirical literature regarding predictors of suicide and best practices for the development of practice guidelines were conducted. Qualitative feedback, empirical predictors of suicide, and design considerations were integrated to develop the R4 tools. A second series of 11 interviews and focus groups with Army leaders and SMEs was also conducted to validate the design and obtain feedback regarding the R4 tools.|Leaders described preferences for tool processes (eg, incorporating engaged leadership, including multiple risk identification methods), formatting (eg, one page), organization (eg, low-intermediate-high risk scoring system), content (eg, excluding other considerations related to vehicle safety, including readiness implications), and implementation (eg, accounting for leadership judgment, tailoring process to specific leadership echelons, consideration of institutional barriers). Evidence-based predictors of suicide risk and practice guideline considerations (eg, design) were integrated with leadership feedback to develop the R4 tools that were tailored to specific leadership echelons. Leaders provided positive feedback regarding the R4 tools and described the importance of accounting for potential institutional barriers to implementation. This feedback was addressed by including recommendations regarding the implementation of standardized support meetings between different echelons of leadership.|The R4 development process entailed the simultaneous integration of leadership feedback with evidence-based predictors of suicide risk and design considerations. Thus, the development of these tools builds upon previous Army leadership tools by specifically tailoring elements of those tools to accommodate leader preferences, accounting for potential implementation barriers (eg, institutional factors), and empirically evaluating the implementation of those tools. Future studies should consider utilizing a similar process to develop empirically based resources that are more likely to be incorporated into the routine practice of leaders supporting soldiers at risk of suicide, very often located at the company level and below."

"%X The U.S. Army developed a new tool called the Behavioral Health Readiness and Suicide Risk Reduction Review (R4) for suicide prevention. A 12-month evaluation study with the primary objective of testing the hypothesis (H1) that Army units receiving R4 would demonstrate improved outcomes in suicidal-behavior measures following the intervention, relative to control, was then conducted. The results of analyses to answer H1 are herein presented.|The R4 intervention (R4-tools/instructions/orientation) evaluation study, Institutional Review Board approved and conducted in May 2019-June 2020, drew samples from two U.S. Army divisions and employed a repeated measurement in pre-/post-quasi-experimental design, including a nonequivalent, but comparable, business-as-usual control. Intervention effectiveness was evaluated using self-report responses to suicide-related measures (Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised/total-suicide behaviors/ideations/plans/attempts/non-suicidal self-injuries) at 6-/12-month intervals. Analyses examined baseline to follow-up linked and cross-sectional cohorts, incidence/prevalence, and intervention higher-/lower-use R4 subanalyses.|Both divisions demonstrated favorable in-study reductions in total-suicide burden, with relatively equivalent trends for total-suicide behaviors, total-suicide risk (Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised), suicidal ideations, and non-suicidal self-injuries. Although both demonstrated reductions in suicide plans, the control showed a more robust trend. Neither division demonstrated a significant reduction in suicide attempts, but subgroup analyses showed a significant reduction in pre-coronavirus disease 2019-attempt incidence among those with higher-use R4 relative to control.|There is no evidence of harm associated with the R4 intervention. R4 effectiveness as a function of R4 itself requires confirmatory study. R4 is judged an improvement (no evidence of harm‰Ûä+‰Ûäweak evidence of effectiveness) over the status quo (no safety data or effectiveness studies) with regard to tool-based decision-making support for suicide prevention in the U.S. Army."

Novel reports by SUP informants of high levels of unit cohesion/morale decreased odds of suicide (ORåÊ=åÊ0.1 [95% CIåÊ=åÊ0.0, 0.2]). Contrary to study hypotheses, no religious affiliation was associated with lower odds of suicide (ORåÊ=åÊ0.3 [95% CIåÊ=åÊ0.2, 0.6]).|Perceived social closeness and unit/group cohesion are associated with lower odds of suicide.

"%X The Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, in conjunction with the American Telemedicine Association's Annual Mid-Year Meeting, conducted a 1-day workshop on how maturing and emerging processes and applications in the field of telemental health (TMH) can be expanded to enhance access to behavioral health services in the Pacific Rim. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together experts in the field of TMH from the military, federal agencies, academia, and regional healthcare organizations serving populations in the Pacific Rim. The workshop reviewed current technologies and systems to better understand their current and potential applications to regional challenges, including the Department of Defense and other federal organizations. The meeting was attended by approximately 100 participants, representing military, government, academia, healthcare centers, and tribal organizations. It was organized into four sessions focusing on the following topic areas: (1) Remote Screening and Assessment; (2) Post-Deployment Adjustment Mental Health Treatment; (3) Suicide Prevention and Management; and (4) Delivery of Training, Education, and Mental Health Work Force Development. The meeting's goal was to discuss challenges, gaps, and collaborative opportunities in this area to enhance existing or create new opportunities for collaborations in the delivery of TMH services to the populations of the Pacific Rim. A set of recommendations for collaboration are presented."

"%X The bystander intervention model is one approach utilized to reduce risky behaviors within the U.S. Army; however, it is unclear how frequently soldiers experience opportunities to intervene and whether they already intervene in such situations. The present analysis aims to ascertain frequencies for opportunities to intervene and the rates at which soldiers intervene when presented with such opportunities. Soldiers ( N = 286) were asked whether they had witnessed particular risky behavior scenarios of interest to the Army (i.e., suicide-related behaviors, alcohol misuse, or sexual harassment/assault) during the previous 2 months and whether they had intervened in those scenarios. Prevalence rates within this sample were calculated to determine the frequency of such situations and subsequent interventions. Logistic regression was used to ascertain any differences in witnessing scenarios by demographic groups. Nearly half (46.8%) of the soldiers reported witnessing at least one scenario involving risky behaviors. Most soldiers who witnessed an event relating to suicide or alcohol misuse also reported consistently intervening (87.9% and 74.4%, respectively), whereas just half consistently intervened in response to scenarios relating to sexual harassment/assault (49.2%). Lower ranking soldiers were twice as likely as higher ranks to witness scenarios involving alcohol misuse (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [1.11, 4.26]) and sexual harassment/assault (odds ratio = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [1.05, 4.62]). These data indicate that soldiers regularly encounter opportunities to intervene in risky behaviors, and while a majority intervened in such scenarios, more training is warranted, particularly around sexual assault and harassment. This supports the notion that bystander intervention training is a worthwhile investment for the Army."

"%X Limited data are available on lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of psychological disorders and suicidal behaviors among Army personnel. We used simulation methods to approximate such estimates based on analysis of data from a U.S. national general population survey with the sociodemographic profile of U.S. Army personnel. Estimated lifetime prevalence of any Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) anxiety, mood, behavior, or substance disorder in this sample was 53.1% (17.7% for mood disorders, 27.2% for anxiety disorders, 22.7% for behavior disorders, and 14.4% for substance disorders). The vast majority of cases had onsets before the expected age of enlistment if they were in the Army (91.6%). Lifetime prevalence was 14.2% for suicidal ideation, 5.4% for suicide plans, and 4.5% for suicide attempts. The proportion of estimated preenlistment onsets was between 68.4% (suicide plans) and 82.4% (suicidal ideation). Externalizing disorders with onsets before expected age of enlistment and internalizing disorders with onsets after expected age of enlistment significantly predicted postenlistment suicide attempts, with population attributable risk proportions of 41.8% and 38.8%, respectively. Implications of these findings are discussed for interventions designed to screen, detect, and treat psychological disorders and suicidality in the Army."

"%X The US Army suicide rate has increased sharply in recent years. Identifying significant predictors of Army suicides in Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records might help focus prevention efforts and guide intervention content. Previous studies of administrative data, although documenting significant predictors, were based on limited samples and models. A career history perspective is used here to develop more textured models.|The analysis was carried out as part of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). De-identified data were combined across numerous Army and DoD administrative data systems for all Regular Army soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009. Multivariate associations of sociodemographics and Army career variables with suicide were examined in subgroups defined by time in service, rank and deployment history.|Several novel results were found that could have intervention implications. The most notable of these were significantly elevated suicide rates (69.6-80.0 suicides per 100åÊ000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100åÊ000 person-years in the total Army) among enlisted soldiers deployed either during their first year of service or with less than expected (based on time in service) junior enlisted rank; a substantially greater rise in suicide among women than men during deployment; and a protective effect of marriage against suicide only during deployment.|A career history approach produces several actionable insights missed in less textured analyses of administrative data predictors. Expansion of analyses to a richer set of predictors might help refine understanding of intervention implications."

"%X Financial stress has been frequently identified as a risk factor for suicidal behavior, both in military and civilian groups. However, it remains unclear to what degree financial stress may be associated independently with suicide behavior when accounting for other risk factors. This study examined data on suicide and suicide attempt cases in the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report compared with service members who did not have recent suicide behavior. The resulting multinomial regression analysis found that financial distress had a weak association with suicide, and its relationship to suicide attempts was not statistically significant. Compared with financial distress, relationship problems and substance abuse history appeared to have much stronger associations with suicidal behavior, as did having a diagnosis of a mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder. The major conclusion from these data are that although financial distress may be a risk factor for suicidal behavior, the relationship is likely indirect and considerably less substantial than previously suspected. In addition, its relative influence is significantly less than other identified risk factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

"%X Given the vast public health problem of suicide, the need for more effective assessment of suicidal risk is clear. The major approaches applied to this challenge include various direct approaches (e.g., suicide-focused interviews) and indirect approaches (e.g., implicit methodologies or ""occult"" assessments) that tend to assess an attentional bias for suicidal risk, the latter of which the present investigation sought to study. Using the Suicide Status Form (SSF)-the central multi-purpose tool that is used within a collaborative assessment process with suicidal patients who are engaged in the ""Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality"" (CAMS; Jobes, 2016)-we aimed to investigate the influence of perseverative, hand-written content responses pertaining to potential suicidal risk. Specifically, we explored whether repeating certain topic content might reflect a perseverative response style; we thus compared written content results of first session SSFs taken from a sample of suicidal U.S. Army Soldiers (Study 1) and a sample of suicidal college students (Study 2). Across the two studies, patients who repeated the same content (""1-Topic Repeaters"") had significantly higher ratings related to suicidal ideation in comparison to those with more heterogeneous response styles. This replicated finding perhaps reveals a form of behavioral perseveration that is potentially related to increased suicidal risk with possible implications for successful treatment."

"%X High levels of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems are associated with suicidal behaviors (i.e., seriously considering and/or attempting suicide) in military and civilian populations. Examination of reasons for drinking alcohol may identify subgroups of soldiers who may either be at risk for suicidal behaviors or resilient to suicidality.|We examined the associations among reasons for drinking, level of alcohol use, and past year suicidality in 3,813 U.S. Army soldiers using the Department of Defense Survey of Health-Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military Personnel.|Six percent of soldiers reported suicidal thoughts and behaviors within the past year.

"%X Much research has focused on stress related to deployments; however, a substantial proportion of soldiers never deploy. In a study of 1.3 million veterans, suicide risk was higher among veterans who had never deployed. Thus, not being deployed may have an impact on soldiers' well-being; however, no measures exist to assess emotions regarding non-deployment. We aimed to develop and test an original measure of non-deployment emotions.|We examined the Non-Deployment Emotions (NDE) questionnaire, a novel four-item measure of guilt, unit value, unit camaraderie, and unit connectedness in a sample of never-deployed male and female US Army Reserve/National Guard (USAR/NG) soldiers (N = 174). Data are from Operation: SAFETY (Soldiers and Families Excelling Through the Years), an ongoing survey-based study examining the health of USAR/NG soldiers and their partners. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The relationship between each of the items was examined by calculating correlation and alpha coefficients. Latent class analyses tested for the existence of distinct levels of negative emotions related to non-deployment. Negative binomial regression models examined the cross-sectional associations between NDE summary score and each of the following outcomes, separately: anger, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress.|More than half of never-deployed USAR/NG soldiers expressed negative emotions for having not been deployed. ""Guilt,"" ""value,"" ""camaraderie,"" and ""connectedness"" were each positively correlated with each other (p < 0.001) and the internal consistency reliability was high (male soldier ë± = 0.90, female soldier ë± = 0.93). Latent class analyses revealed a superior three-class model with well-delineated class membership (entropy = 0.93): ""Class 1"" (low NDE; 47.6%), ""Class 2"" (moderate NDE; 33.8%), and ""Class 3"" (high NDE; 18.6%). Regression models demonstrated that greater non-deployment emotions were independently associated with more severe anger (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03, p < 0.001), anxiety (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11, p < 0.05), depression (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11, p < 0.05), and PTSD (RR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.16, p < 0.01).|Findings demonstrate that negative emotions regarding non-deployment are prevalent among never-deployed USAR/NG soldiers and that these emotions are related to a mental health. The NDE provides a measure of ""guilt,"" ""value,"" ""camaraderie,"" and ""connectedness"" specific to non-deployed soldiers and is able to well discriminate between soldiers that have low, moderately, and highly negative non-deployment emotions. These findings suggest that all military personnel, regardless of deployment status, could be at risk for negative outcomes. As with any survey-based study, there is a potential for response bias; however, given the range of responses collected with the NDE, social desirability is unlikely. Further work is needed to confirm our findings in other components of the military and to examine soldiers in the rear detachment."

"%X Despite significant efforts in suicide prevention over the past several years, suicide rates in the U.S. Army remain largely unchanged. This paper describes a collaborative effort between line-unit leaders, medical personnel, and installation services to synchronize suicide risk identification and communication between these disparate entities.|Under the direction of the Installation Director of Psychological Health at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, a Behavioral Health Process Action Team was chartered to identify best practice and formulate policy for identifying and managing service members at risk for suicide.|Compliance with the new policy reached 100% within 6 months of implementation, as measured by peer review of records. This installation policy was subsequently identified as a best practice and adopted Army-wide as the standard of practice.|Knowledge transfer of research findings into policy and practice is crucial for suicide prevention. The current policy shows good integration of current research with practice in military settings.|Combined efforts in crafting policy for risk identification and communication resulted in a policy that was acceptable and feasible from the perspective of commanders and clinicians. Synchronization efforts between commanders, clinicians, and support services are crucial to ensure effective intervention to prevent suicide behavior."

"%X This study describes a randomized controlled trial called ""Operation Worth Living"" (OWL) which compared the use of the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) to enhanced care as usual (E-CAU). We hypothesized that CAMS would be more effective than E-CAU for reducing suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA), along with secondary behavioral health and health care utilization markers for U.S. Army Soldier outpatients with significant SI (i.e., > 13 on Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation).|Study participants were 148 Soldiers who presented to a military outpatient behavioral health clinic. There were 73 Soldiers in the experimental arm of the trial who received adherent CAMS; 75 Soldiers received E-CAU. Nine a-priori treatment outcomes (SI, past year SA, suicide-related emergency department (ED) admits, behavioral health-related ED admits, suicide-related inpatient psychiatric unit (IPU) days, behavioral health-related IPU days, mental health, psychiatric distress, resiliency) were measured through assessments at Baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-Baseline (with a 78% retention of intent-to-treat participants at 12 months).|Soldiers in both arms of the trial responded to study treatments in terms of all primary and secondary outcomes (effect sizes ranged from 0.63 to 12.04). CAMS participants were significantly less likely to have any suicidal thoughts by 3 months in comparison to those in E-CAU (Cohen's d = 0.93, p=.028).|Soldiers receiving CAMS and E-CAU significantly improved post-treatment. Those who received CAMS were less likely to report SI at 3 months; further group differences were not otherwise seen."

"%X The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase basic knowledge about the determinants of suicidality. This report presents an overview of the designs of the six components of the Army STARRS. These include: an integrated analysis of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) designed to provide data on significant administrative predictors of suicides among the more than 1.6 million soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009; retrospective case-control studies of suicide attempts and fatalities; separate large-scale cross-sectional studies of new soldiers (i.e. those just beginning Basic Combat Training [BCT], who completed self-administered questionnaires [SAQs] and neurocognitive tests and provided blood samples) and soldiers exclusive of those in BCT (who completed SAQs); a pre-post deployment study of soldiers in three Brigade Combat Teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (who completed SAQs and provided blood samples) followed multiple times after returning from deployment; and a platform for following up Army STARRS participants who have returned to civilian life. Department of Defense/Army administrative data records are linked with SAQ data to examine prospective associations between self-reports and subsequent suicidality. The presentation closes with a discussion of the methodological advantages of cross-component coordination."

"%X The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multi-component epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable recommendations to reduce US Army suicides and increase knowledge about determinants of suicidality. Three Army STARRS component studies are large-scale surveys: one of new soldiers prior to beginning Basic Combat Training (BCT; n‰Ûä=‰Ûä50,765 completed self-administered questionnaires); another of other soldiers exclusive of those in BCT (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä35,372); and a third of three Brigade Combat Teams about to deploy to Afghanistan who are being followed multiple times after returning from deployment (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä9421). Although the response rates in these surveys are quite good (72.0-90.8%), questions can be raised about sample biases in estimating prevalence of mental disorders and suicidality, the main outcomes of the surveys based on evidence that people in the general population with mental disorders are under-represented in community surveys. This paper presents the results of analyses designed to determine whether such bias exists in the Army STARRS surveys and, if so, to develop weights to correct for these biases. Data are also presented on sample inefficiencies introduced by weighting and sample clustering and on analyses of the trade-off between bias and efficiency in weight trimming."

However, the suicide rates in these two categories were significantly lower when currently deployed (30.6/100 000 person-years) than never deployed or previously deployed (41.2-39.1/100 000 person-years), whereas the suicide rate of other soldiers was significantly higher when currently deployed and previously deployed (20.2-22.4/100 000 person-years) than never deployed (14.5/100 000 person-years), resulting in the adjusted suicide rate of infantrymen and combat engineers being most elevated when never deployed [odds ratio (OR) 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-4.1], less so when previously deployed (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.1), and not at all when currently deployed (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.8). Adjustment for a differential 'healthy warrior effect' cannot explain this variation in the relative suicide rates of never-deployed infantrymen and combat engineers by deployment status.|Efforts are needed to elucidate the causal mechanisms underlying this interaction to guide preventive interventions for soldiers at high suicide risk."

Administrative data available before hospital discharge abstracted from a wide range of data systems (sociodemographic, US Army career, criminal justice, and medical or pharmacy) were used to predict suicides in the subsequent 12 months using machine learning methods (regression trees and penalized regressions) designed to evaluate cross-validated linear, nonlinear, and interactive predictive associations.|Suicides of soldiers hospitalized with psychiatric disorders in the 12 months after hospital discharge.|Sixty-eight soldiers died by suicide within 12 months of hospital discharge (12.0% of all US Army suicides), equivalent to 263.9 suicides per 100,000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100,000 person-years in the total US Army. The strongest predictors included sociodemographics (male sex [odds ratio (OR), 7.9; 95% CI, 1.9-32.6] and late age of enlistment [OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5]), criminal offenses (verbal violence [OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0] and weapons possession [OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-18.3]), prior suicidality [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9], aspects of prior psychiatric inpatient and outpatient treatment (eg, number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the past 12 months [OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7]), and disorders diagnosed during the focal hospitalizations (eg, nonaffective psychosis [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.0]). A total of 52.9% of posthospitalization suicides occurred after the 5% of hospitalizations with highest predicted suicide risk (3824.1 suicides per 100,000 person-years). These highest-risk hospitalizations also accounted for significantly elevated proportions of several other adverse posthospitalization outcomes (unintentional injury deaths, suicide attempts, and subsequent hospitalizations).|The high concentration of risk of suicide and other adverse outcomes might justify targeting expanded posthospitalization interventions to soldiers classified as having highest posthospitalization suicide risk, although final determination requires careful consideration of intervention costs, comparative effectiveness, and possible adverse effects."

Administrative data available before hospital discharge abstracted from a wide range of data systems (sociodemographic, US Army career, criminal justice, and medical or pharmacy) were used to predict suicides in the subsequent 12 months using machine learning methods (regression trees and penalized regressions) designed to evaluate cross-validated linear, nonlinear, and interactive predictive associations.|Suicides of soldiers hospitalized with psychiatric disorders in the 12 months after hospital discharge.|Sixty-eight soldiers died by suicide within 12 months of hospital discharge (12.0% of all US Army suicides), equivalent to 263.9 suicides per 100,000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100,000 person-years in the total US Army. The strongest predictors included sociodemographics (male sex [odds ratio (OR), 7.9; 95% CI, 1.9-32.6] and late age of enlistment [OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5]), criminal offenses (verbal violence [OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0] and weapons possession [OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-18.3]), prior suicidality [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9], aspects of prior psychiatric inpatient and outpatient treatment (eg, number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the past 12 months [OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7]), and disorders diagnosed during the focal hospitalizations (eg, nonaffective psychosis [OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.0]). A total of 52.9% of posthospitalization suicides occurred after the 5% of hospitalizations with highest predicted suicide risk (3824.1 suicides per 100,000 person-years). These highest-risk hospitalizations also accounted for significantly elevated proportions of several other adverse posthospitalization outcomes (unintentional injury deaths, suicide attempts, and subsequent hospitalizations).|The high concentration of risk of suicide and other adverse outcomes might justify targeting expanded posthospitalization interventions to soldiers classified as having highest posthospitalization suicide risk, although final determination requires careful consideration of intervention costs, comparative effectiveness, and possible adverse effects."

"%X Suicides within the U.S. Armed Forces remain elevated. Brief cognitive behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (BCBT) has demonstrated preliminary efficacy as a psychotherapeutic intervention that reduces suicide attempts among U.S. Army Soldiers. The generalizability of BCBT's effects in other military groups and its underlying mechanisms of action remain unknown, however. The Marine Suicide Prevention and Intervention REsearch (M-SPIRE) study is designed to test the efficacy of BCBT for the prevention of suicide attempts among active duty U.S. Marines with recent suicidal ideation or attempts and to identify potential mechanisms of change contributing to BCBT's effects. In this protocol paper, we describe M-SPIRE's rationale and methods with a particular emphasis on measuring treatment fidelity and BCBT's hypothesized mechanisms of action."

Characteristics analyzed included subcommand, military activity, operational posture, and manner of death.|Of 614 USSOCOM fatalities (median age, 30 years; male, 98.5%) the leading cause of death was injury (97.7%); specifically, multiple/blunt force injury (34.5%), blast injury (30.7%), gunshot wound (GSW; 30.3%), and other (4.5%). Most died outside the United States (87.1%), during combat operations (85.3%), in the prehospital environment (91.5%), and the same day of insult (90.4%). Most fatalities were with the US Army Special Operations Command (67.6%), followed by the Naval Special Warfare Command (16.0%), Air Force Special Operations Command (9.3%), and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (7.2%). Of 54.6% who died of injuries incurred during mounted operations, most were on ground vehicles (53.7%), followed by rotary-wing (37.3%) and fixed-wing (9.0%) aircrafts. The manner of death was primarily homicide (66.0%) and accident (30.5%), followed by natural (2.1%), suicide (0.8%), and undetermined (0.7%).

This study aimed to examine how unmet need for treatment or support among U.S. Army soldiers relates to future suicidal ideation (SI) or suicide attempt (SA).|Mental health treatment need and help seeking in the past 12 months were evaluated for soldiers (N=4,645) who subsequently deployed to Afghanistan. Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine the prospective association of predeployment treatment needs with SI and SA during and after deployment, with adjustment for potential confounders.|Compared with soldiers without predeployment treatment needs, those who reported not seeking help despite needing it had increased risk for SI during deployment (adjusted OR [AOR]=1.73), past-30-day SI at 2-3 months postdeployment (AOR=2.08), past-30-day SI at 8-9 months postdeployment (AOR=2.01), and SA through 8-9 months postdeployment (AOR=3.65). Soldiers who sought help and stopped treatment without improvement had elevated SI risk at 2-3 months postdeployment (AOR=2.35). Those who sought help and stopped after improving did not have increased SI risk during or 2-3 months after deployment but had elevated risks for SI (AOR=1.71) and SA (AOR=3.43) by 8-9 months postdeployment. Risks for all suicidality outcomes were also elevated among soldiers who reported receiving ongoing treatment before deployment.|Unmet or ongoing needs for mental health treatment or support before deployment are associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior during and after deployment. Detecting and addressing treatment needs among soldiers before deployment may help prevent suicidality during deployment and reintegration periods."

Nineteen hundred fifty-nine (72%) slept ‰ä_ 6 h, but only 16% reported a daytime nap or felt their job performance was affected due to lack of sleep. Short sleep was more common among soldiers who reported combat exposure. After controlling for combat exposure, short sleep duration (SSD) was associated with symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic syndrome, and with high-risk health behaviors such as abuse of tobacco and alcohol products, and suicide attempts.|SSD is common among redeployed soldiers. Soldiers who experienced combat are at increased risk for persistent SSD and comorbidities associated with SSD. Efforts to reestablish good sleep habits and aggressive evaluation of soldiers with persistent SSD following deployment may aid in the prevention and management of associated medical conditions."

"%X In order to best tailor suicide prevention initiatives and programs, it is critical to gain an understanding of how service members__ suicide risk factors may differ by gender. We aimed to better understand gender differences in suicide and suicide attempts among soldiers, including demographic, military, mental health, and other risk factors. We also examined risk factors uniquely associated with suicide and suicide attempts. We conducted a retrospective study of 1857 US Army soldiers who died by suicide or attempted suicide between 2008 and 2010 and had a Department of Defense Suicide Event Report. Female and male soldiers had more similarities than differences when examining risk factors associated with suicide. The only gender difference approaching significance was workplace difficulties, which was more strongly associated with suicide for female soldiers, compared to their male counterparts. Among suicide decedents, the most common risk factor was having a failed intimate relationship in the 90 days prior to suicide. Among those who attempted suicide, the most common risk factor was a major psychiatric diagnosis. Better understanding both gender differences and risk factors uniquely associated with suicide has critical prevention and public health implications as we work to better understand preventable mortality in our youngest generation of service members."

"%X Understanding mental health predictors of imminent suicide attempt (SA; within 30 days) among soldiers with depression and no prior suicide ideation (SI) can inform prevention and treatment. The current study aimed to identify sociodemographic and service-related characteristics and mental disorder predictors associated with imminent SA among U.S. Army soldiers following first documented major depression diagnosis (MDD) with no history of SI.|In this case-control study using Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS) administrative data, we identified 101,046 active-duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers (2010-2016) with medically-documented MDD and no prior SI (MDD/No-SI). We examined risk factors for SA within 30 days of first MDD/No-SI using logistic regression analyses, including socio-demographic/service-related characteristics and psychiatric diagnoses.|The 101,046 soldiers with documented MDD/No-SI were primarily male (78.0%), <‰Ûä29 years old (63.9%), White (58.1%), high school-educated (74.5%), currently married (62.0%) and <‰Ûä21 when first entering the Army (56.9%).

"%X The authors sought to identify predictors of imminent suicide attempt (within 30 days) among U.S. Army soldiers following their first documented suicidal ideation.|Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers, the authors identified 11,178 active-duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers (2006-2009) with medically documented suicidal ideation and no prior medically documented suicide attempts. The authors examined risk factors for suicide attempt within 30 days of first suicidal ideation using logistic regression analyses, including sociodemographic and service-related characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, physical health care visits, injuries, and history of family violence or crime perpetration or victimization.|Among soldiers with first documented suicidal ideation, 830 (7.4%) attempted suicide, 46.3% of whom (N=387) attempted suicide within 30 days (rate, 35.4 per 1,000 soldiers). Following a series of multivariate analyses, the final model identified females (odds ratio=1.3, 95% CI=1.0, 1.8), combat medics (odds ratio=1.6, 95% CI=1.1, 2.2), individuals with an anxiety disorder diagnosis prior to suicidal ideation (odds ratio=1.3, 95% CI=1.0, 1.6), and those who received a sleep disorder diagnosis on the same day as the recorded suicidal ideation (odds ratio=2.3, 95% CI=1.1, 4.6) as being more likely to attempt suicide within 30 days. Black soldiers (odds ratio=0.6, 95% CI=0.4, 0.9) and those who received an anxiety disorder diagnosis on the same day as suicidal ideation (odds ratio=0.7, 95% CI=0.5, 0.9) were less likely.|Suicide attempt risk is highest in the first 30 days following ideation diagnosis and is more likely among women, combat medics, and soldiers with an anxiety disorder diagnosis before suicidal ideation and a same-day sleep disorder diagnosis. Black soldiers and those with a same-day anxiety disorder diagnosis were at decreased risk. These factors may help identify soldiers at imminent risk of suicide attempt."

"%X The association between disability and cause of death in Veterans with service-connected disabilities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare age at death, military service and disability characteristics, including disability rating, and cause of death by year of birth. We also examined cause of death for specific service-connected conditions.|This study used information from the VETSNET file, which is a snapshot of selected items from the Veterans Benefits Administration corporate database. We also used the National Death Index (NDI) for Veterans which is part of the VA Suicide Data Repository. In VETSNET, there were 758,324 Veterans who had a service-connected condition and died between the years 2004 and 2014. Using the scrambled social security number to link the two files resulted in 605,493 (80%) deceased Veterans. Age at death, sex, and underlying cause of death were obtained from the NDI for Veterans and military service characteristics and types of disability were acquired from VETSNET. We constructed age categories corresponding to period of service; birth years 1938 and earlier corresponded to Korea and World War II (""oldest""), birth years 1939-1957 to the Vietnam era (""middle""), and birth years 1958 and later to post Vietnam, Gulf War, and the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (""youngest"").|Sixty-two percent were in the oldest age category, 34% in the middle group, and 4% in the youngest one. The overall age at death was 75 å± 13 yr. Only 1.6% of decedents were women; among women 25% were in the youngest age group, while among men only 4% were in the youngest group. Most decedents were enlisted personnel, and 60% served in the U.S. Army. Nearly 61% had a disability rating of >50% and for the middle age group 54% had a disability rating of 100%. The most common service-connected conditions were tinnitus, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the oldest group, nearly half of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions and <2% were due to external causes. In the youngest group, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for about 1/3 of deaths, whereas external causes or deaths due to accidents, suicide, or assault accounted for nearly 33% of deaths. For Veterans with service-connected PTSD or major depression; 6.5% of deaths were due to external causes whereas for Veterans without these conditions, only 3.1% were due to external causes.|The finding of premature death due to external causes in the youngest age group as well as the finding of higher proportions of external causes in those with PTSD or major depression should be of great concern to those who care for Veterans."

This study identified rates of suicidality (seriously considering or attempting suicide) and types of mental health services used in the past 12 months by active duty Army soldiers.|This study used the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel, which sampled 10,400 Army soldiers from a total population of 508,088 soldiers. Mental health service utilization included receiving counseling or therapy from a general medical doctor, receiving counseling or therapy from a mental health professional, and being prescribed medications for depression, anxiety, or sleep. Suicidality was assessed via self-report questions.|Thirteen percent had seriously considered or attempted suicide at some point in their lives, 7% since joining the military. One percent who reported suicidality since joining the Army reported having considered or attempted suicide in the past year. After the analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, soldiers who seriously considered or attempted suicide since joining the military versus those who did not were 1.71 times more likely to have used a mental health service, 2.33 times more likely to have used two or more types of services, 1.82 times more likely to have seen a mental health specialist, and 1.67 times more likely to have received medication in the past year.|Understanding the relationship between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and the specific levels and types of mental health services received in this military population is important for health care provision and planning."

"%X Active service members and Veterans with a combat-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) are four times more likely to attempt suicide than those without a TBI. TBIs are the signature injuries of the Post-9/11 conflicts and Combat Veterans (i.e., current and former service members who deployed in support of a combat mission) with these injuries are entitled to receive the Purple Heart medal. However, potentially tens of thousands of Combat Veterans did not receive, or were denied the Purple Heart during the first decade of the Global War on Terrorism because a TBI was not documented during the deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the meaning of the Purple Heart and examine the impact of the Purple Heart on Army Combat Veterans with a combat-related TBI. Findings from this mixed methods study revealed that not receiving the Purple Heart is associated with increased suicide risk and lower quality of life after a brain injury. Additionally, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and perceived military institutional betrayal are associated with increased suicide risk in Army Combat Veterans with a TBI. This mixed methods study provides important insights into how Army culture is perceived and the power of the Purple Heart among this high-risk group of Combat Veterans."

"%X Exploration of the validity of death certificate information for classifying underlying causes of death has historically focused on ""natural"" or disease-related causes of death. Current interest in injury-related deaths has emphasized the need for proper certification and coding of these deaths. In this study, the authors compared agreement of the underlying cause of death as determined from death certificate information with that determined from an independent review of all relevant medical and legal documents of death by a panel of physicians. The study sample included all deaths (n = 446) occurring over an approximately 18-year follow-up period (1965-1983) in a randomly selected cohort of 18,313 US Army Veterans of the Vietnam era. Using the physician panel as the ""gold standard,"" sensitivity and specificity were 90% or greater for broad groupings of motor vehicle crash deaths (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes E810-E825), suicides (codes E950-E959), and homicides (codes E960-E969). Agreement for deaths from unintentional poisonings (codes E850-E869), mostly drug- and alcohol-related, was poor (sensitivity, 50 percent); in general, the ICD-9 drug- and alcohol-specific nomenclature is difficult to apply. The specificity and sensitivity for the individual three-digit suicide and homicide codes were all greater than 90%, and although the specificity for three-digit motor vehicle crash deaths was also above 90%, the sensitivity was lower, from 29% to 83%. Agreement on the fourth digit of ICD-9--for example, the role of the decedent in a motor vehicle crash death--was generally poor. The lack of descriptive information on death certificates to allow detailed coding was chiefly responsible for the poor agreement."

"%X Responding to an unprecedented increase in the suicide rate among soldiers, in 2008 the US Army and US National Institute of Mental Health funded the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study of risk and resilience factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and their psychopathological correlates among Army personnel. Using a combination of administrative records, representative surveys, computerized neurocognitive tests, and blood samples, Army STARRS and its longitudinal follow-up study (STARRS-LS) are designed to identify potentially actionable findings to inform the Army's suicide prevention efforts. The current report presents a broad overview of Army STARRS and its findings to date on suicide deaths, attempts, and ideation, as well as other important outcomes that may increase suicide risk (e.g., mental disorders, sexual assault victimization). The findings highlight the complexity of environmental and genetic risk and protective factors in different settings and contexts, and the importance of life and career history in understanding suicidal thoughts and behaviors."

"%X To examine sex differences in risk for administratively documented suicide attempt (SA) among US Army soldiers during the Iraq/Afghanistan wars.|Using administrative person-month records of Regular Army enlisted soldiers from 2004 to 2009, we identified 9650 person-months with a first documented SA and an equal-probability control sample (n=153,528 person-months). Person-months were weighted to the population and pooled over time. After examining the association of sex with SA in a logistic regression analysis, predictors were examined separately among women and men.|Women (an estimated 13.7% of the population) accounted for 25.2% of SAs and were more likely than men to attempt suicide after adjusting for sociodemographic, service-related, and mental health diagnosis (MHDx) variables (odds ratio=1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7). Women with increased odds of SA in a given person-month were younger, non-Hispanic White, less educated, in their first term of enlistment, never or previously deployed (vs. currently deployed), and previously received a MHDx. The same variables predicted SA among men. Interactions indicated significant but generally small differences between women and men on 6 of the 8 predictors, the most pronounced being time in service, deployment status, and MHDx. Discrete-time survival models examining risk by time in service demonstrated that patterns for women and men were similar, and that women's initially higher risk diminished as time in service increased.|Predictors of documented SAs are similar for US Army women and men. Differences associated with time in service, deployment status, and MHDx require additional research. Future research should consider stressors that disproportionately affect women."

"%X Risk for suicide attempt (SA) versus suicide ideation (SI) is clinically important and difficult to differentiate. We examined whether a history of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) differentiates soldiers with a recent SA from nonattempting soldiers with current/recent SI.|Using a unique case-control design, we administered the same questionnaire (assessing the history of SITBs and psychosocial variables) to representative U.S. Army soldiers recently hospitalized for SA (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä132) and soldiers from the same Army installations who reported 30-day SI but did not make an attempt (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä125). Logistic regression analyses examined whether SITBs differentiated attempters and ideators after controlling for previously identified covariates.|In separate models that weighted for systematic nonresponse and controlled for gender, education, posttraumatic stress disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder, SA was positively and significantly associated with the history of suicide plan and/or intention to act (odds ratio [OR]‰Ûä=‰Ûä12.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}‰Ûä=‰Ûä3.6-40.4]), difficulty controlling suicidal thoughts during the worst week of ideation (OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä3.5 [95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.1-11.3]), and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) (OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä4.9 [95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.3-18.0]). Area under the curve was 0.87 in a full model that combined these SITBs and covariates. The top ventile based on predicted risk had a sensitivity of 24.7%, specificity of 99.8%, and positive predictive value of 97.5%.|History of suicide plan/intention, difficult to control ideation, and NSSI differentiate soldiers with recent SA from those with current/recent SI independent of sociodemographic characteristics and mental disorders. Longitudinal research is needed to determine whether these factors are prospectively associated with the short-term transition from SI to SA."

"%X This prospective cohort study used administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers to examine associations between neurocognitive functioning and subsequent suicidal events among Regular Army enlisted soldiers during the years 2004-2009. Cases were all soldiers who completed the Army's Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) computerized testing battery prior to documented suicide attempt (nåÊ=åÊ607), ideation (nåÊ=åÊ955), or death (nåÊ=åÊ57). Controls were an equal-probability sample of 9,893 person-months from other soldiers. Exploratory factor analysis of five ANAM tests identified a general neurocognitive factor that excluded the mathematic processing test (MTH). When examined separately in logistic regression analyses that controlled for sociodemographics and prior mental health diagnosis, both the general neurocognitive factor (logit [ë_]åÊ=åÊ-.197 to -.521; påÊ<åÊ.01) and MTH (ë_åÊ=åÊ-.024 to -.064; påÊ<åÊ.05) were associated with all outcomes. When both predictors were examined simultaneously, the general neurocognitive factor continued to be associated with all outcomes (ë_åÊ=åÊ-.164 to -.417; påÊ<åÊ.05) and MTH continued to be associated with suicide attempt (ë_åÊ=åÊ-.015; påÊ=åÊ.046) and ideation (ë_åÊ=åÊ-.014; påÊ=åÊ.018). These small but robust associations suggest that future research must continue to examine the extent to which objective neurocognitive tests may enhance understanding and prediction of suicide risk."

"%X We examined early first deployment and subsequent suicide attempt among U.S. Army soldiers.|Using 2004-2009 administrative data and person-month records of first-term, Regular Army, enlisted soldiers with one deployment (89.2% male), we identified 1,704 soldiers with a documented suicide attempt during or after first deployment and an equal-probability control sample (nåÊ=åÊ25,861 person-months).|Logistic regression analyses indicated soldiers deployed within the first 12åÊmonths of service were more likely than later deployers to attempt suicide (ORåÊ=åÊ1.7 [95% CIåÊ=åÊ1.5-1.8]). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, service-related characteristics, and previous mental health diagnosis slightly attenuated this association (ORåÊ=åÊ1.6 [95% CIåÊ=åÊ1.5-1.8]). Results were not modified by gender, deployment status, military occupation, or mental health diagnosis. The population-attributable risk proportion for deploying within the first 12åÊmonths of service was 17.8%. Linear spline models indicated similar risk patterns over time for early and later deployers, peaking at month 9 during deployment and month 5 postdeployment; however, monthly suicide attempt rates were consistently higher for early deployers.|Enlisted soldiers deployed within the first 12åÊmonths of service have elevated risk of suicide attempt during and after first deployment. Improved understanding of why early deployment increases risk can inform the development of policies and intervention programs."

"%X Although the majority of active duty U.S. Army soldiers are full-time personnel in the Active Component (AC), a substantial minority of soldiers on active duty are in the Reserve Components (RCs). These ""citizen-soldiers"" (Army National Guard and Army Reserve) represent a force available for rapid activation in times of national need. RC soldiers experience many of the same stressors as AC soldiers as well as stressors that are unique to their intermittent service. Despite the important role of RC soldiers, the vast majority of military mental health research focuses on AC soldiers. One important goal of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is to address this gap. Here we examine predictors of suicide attempts among activated RC soldiers.|This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study used individual-level person-month records from Army and Department of Defense administrative data systems to examine socio-demographic, service-related, and mental health predictors of medically documented suicide attempts among activated RC soldiers during 2004-2009. Data from all 1103 activated RC suicide attempters and an equal-probability sample of 69,867 control person-months were analyzed using a discrete-time survival framework.|Enlisted soldiers comprised 84.3% of activated RC soldiers and accounted for 95.7% of all activated RC suicide attempts (overall rate‰Ûä=‰Ûä108/100,000 person-years, more than four times the rate among officers). Multivariable predictors of enlisted RC suicide attempts included being female, entering Army service at age‰Ûä‰ä´‰Ûä25, current age‰Ûä<‰Ûä30, non-Hispanic white, less than high school education, currently married, having 1-2‰Ûäyears of service, being previously deployed (vs. currently deployed), and history of mental health diagnosis (particularly when documented in the previous month). Predictors among RC officers (overall rate‰Ûä=‰Ûä26/100,000 person-years) included being female and receiving a mental health diagnosis in the previous month. Discrete-time hazard models showed suicide attempt risk among enlisted soldiers was inversely associated with time in service.|Risk factors for suicide attempt in the RCs were similar to those previously observed in the AC, highlighting the importance of research and prevention focused on RC enlisted soldiers in the early phases of Army service and those with a recent mental health diagnosis."

"%X Most people with suicide ideation (SI) do not attempt suicide (SA). Understanding the transition from current/recent SI to SA is important for mental health care. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate SA from 30-day SI among representative U.S. Army soldiers.|Using a unique case-control design, soldiers recently hospitalized for SA (nåÊ=åÊ132) and representative soldiers from the same four communities (nåÊ=åÊ10,193) were administered the same questionnaire. We systematically identified variables that differentiated suicide attempters from the total population, then examined whether those same variables differentiated all 30-day ideators (nåÊ=åÊ257) from the total population and attempters from nonattempting 30-day ideators.|In univariable analyses, 20 of 23 predictors were associated with SA in the total population (0.05 level). The best multivariable model included eight significant predictors: interpersonal violence, relationship problems, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorder (all having positive associations), as well as past 12-month combat trauma, intermittent explosive disorder (IED), and any college education (all having negative associations). Six of these differentiated 30-day ideators from the population. Three differentiated attempters from ideators: past 30-day PTSD (ORåÊ=åÊ6.7 [95% CI =åÊ1.1-39.4]), past 30-day IED (ORåÊ=åÊ0.2 [95% CI =åÊ0.1-0.5]), and any college education (ORåÊ=åÊ0.1 [95% CI =åÊ0.0-0.6]). The 5% of ideators with highest predicted risk in this final model included 20.9% of attempters, a four-fold concentration of risk.|Prospective army research examining transition from SI to SA should consider PTSD, IED, and education. Combat exposure did not differentiate attempters from ideators. Many SA risk factors in the Army population are actually risk factors for SI."

"%X Approximately one-third of US soldiers who attempt suicide have not received a mental health diagnosis (MH-Dx) before their suicide attempt (SA), yet little is known about risk factors for SA in those with no MH-Dx.|To examine whether premilitary mental health is associated with medically documented SA among US Army soldiers who do not receive an MH-Dx before their SA.|This cohort study used data from a representative survey of soldiers in the US Army entering basic combat training from April 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012, who were followed up via administrative records for the first 48 months of service. Analyses were conducted from April 5, 2021, to January 21, 2022. Regular Army enlisted soldiers (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä21‰Ûø772) recruited from 3 US Army installations during the first week of service who agreed to have their administrative records linked to their survey responses were included.|Preenlistment lifetime history of mental disorder, suicide ideation, SA, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) as reported during the baseline survey. Service-acquired MH-Dx and sociodemographic and service-related variables were identified using administrative records.|Documented SAs were identified using administrative medical records. Using a discrete-time survival framework, linear splines examined the pattern of SA risk over the first 48 months of service. Logistic regression analysis examined associations of lifetime baseline survey variables with subsequent, medically documented SA among soldiers who did vs did not receive an MH-Dx during service. Models were adjusted for time in service and sociodemographic and service-related variables.|Of the 21‰Ûø722 respondents (86.2% male, 20.4% Black, 61.8% White non-Hispanic), 253 made an SA in the first 48 months of service (male [75.4%]; Black [22.7%], White non-Hispanic [59.9%], or other race or ethnicity [17.4%]). Risk of SA peaked toward the end of the first year of service for both those who did and did not receive an MH-Dx during service. Of the 42.3% of individuals reporting at least 1 of the 4 baseline risk factors, 50.2% received an administrative MH-Dx during service vs 41.5% of those with none, and 1.6% had a documented SA vs 1.0% of those with none. Among individuals with no MH-Dx, medically documented SAs were associated with suicide ideation (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.4), SA (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 4.3-29.2), and NSSI (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.8). For those who received an MH-Dx, medically documented SAs were associated with mental disorder (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9), SA (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.1-5.6), and NSSI (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8). Interactions indicated the only explanatory variable that differed based on history of MH-Dx was preenlistment SA (ìà21‰Ûä=‰Ûä4.7; P‰Ûä=‰Ûä.03), which had a larger OR among soldiers with no MH-Dx than among those with an MH-Dx.|In this study, the period of greatest SA risk and baseline risk factors for SA were similar in soldiers with and without an MH-Dx. This finding suggests that knowledge of the time course and preenlistment mental health factors can equally aid in identifying SA risk in soldiers who do and do not receive an MH-Dx."

"%X Emotion reactivity and risk behaviors (ERRB) are transdiagnostic dimensions associated with suicide attempt (SA). ERRB patterns may identify individuals at increased risk of future SAs.|A representative sample of US Army soldiers entering basic combat training (|Of 21 772 respondents (86.2% male, 61.8% White non-Hispanic), 253 made a SA. Four ERRB classes were identified: 'Indirect Harming' (8.9% of soldiers), 'Impulsive' (19.3%), 'Risk-Taking' (16.3%), and 'Low ERRB' (55.6%). Compared to Low ERRB, Impulsive [OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-2.4)] and Risk-Taking [OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.2)] had higher odds of SA after adjusting for covariates. The ERRB class and MH-Dx interaction was non-significant. Within each class, SA risk varied across service time.|SA risk within the four identified ERRB classes varied across service time. Impulsive and Risk-Taking soldiers had increased risk of future SA. MH-Dx did not modify these associations, which may therefore help identify risk in those not yet receiving mental healthcare."

"%X Suicide is difficult to predict and prevent and remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Although soldiers historically have had a suicide rate well below that of the general population, the suicide rate among members of the U.S. Army has increased markedly over the past several years and now exceeds that of the general population. This paper reviews psychosocial factors known to be associated with the increased risk of suicidal behavior in general and describes how some of these factors may be especially important in understanding suicide among soldiers. Moving forward, the prevention of suicide requires additional research aimed at: (a) better describing when, where, and among whom suicidal behavior occurs, (b) using exploratory studies to discover new risk and protective factors, (c) developing new methods of predicting suicidal behavior that synthesize information about modifiable risk and protective factors from multiple domains, and (d) understanding the mechanisms and pathways through which suicidal behavior develops. Although the scope and severity of this problem is daunting, the increasing attention and dedication to this issue by the Armed Forces, scientists, and society provide hope for our ability to better predict and prevent these tragic outcomes in the future."

"%X The suicide rate has increased significantly among US Army soldiers over the past decade. Here we report the first results from a large psychological autopsy study using two control groups designed to reveal risk factors for suicide death among soldiers beyond known sociodemographic factors and the presence of suicide ideation.|Informants were next-of-kin and Army supervisors for: 135 suicide cases, 137 control soldiers propensity-score-matched on known sociodemographic risk factors for suicide and Army history variables, and 118 control soldiers who reported suicide ideation in the past year.|Results revealed that most (79.3%) soldiers who died by suicide have a prior mental disorder; mental disorders in the prior 30-days were especially strong risk factors for suicide death. Approximately half of suicide decedents tell someone that they are considering suicide. Virtually all of the risk factors identified in this study differed between suicide cases and propensity-score-matched controls, but did not significantly differ between suicide cases and suicide ideators. The most striking difference between suicides and ideators was the presence in the former of an internalizing disorder (especially depression) and multi-morbidity (i.e. 3+ disorders) in the past 30 days.|Most soldiers who die by suicide have identifiable mental disorders shortly before their death and tell others about their suicidal thinking, suggesting that there are opportunities for prevention and intervention. However, few risk factors distinguish between suicide ideators and decedents, pointing to an important direction for future research."

"%X The majority of studies comparing active psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not find significant differences at posttreatment. This was the case in a recent trial examining prolonged exposure (PE) and virtual reality exposure (VRE) among active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD. Matching individual patients to specific treatments provides a potential avenue to improve significantly the public health impact of effective treatments for PTSD. A composite moderator approach was used to identify profiles of patients who would see superior PTSD symptom reduction in VRE or PE to inform future treatment matching.|Active duty U.S. army soldiers (NåÊ=åÊ108) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing VRE and PE in the treatment of PTSD stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen baseline variables were examined to identify treatment response heterogeneity in two patient groups: those with a superior response to PE and those with a superior response to VRE. The final composite moderator comprised four of 18 baseline variables.|Results revealed that patients who were predicted to see greater PTSD symptom reduction in VRE were likely to be younger, not taking antidepressant medication, had greater PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, and were more likely to have greater than minimal suicide risk.|Results suggest that treatment matching based on patient profiles could meaningfully improve treatment efficacy for combat-related PTSD. Future research can build on these results to improve our understanding of how to improve treatment matching for PTSD."

"%X Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a pandemic concern for many nations. When this disease first presented itself in a global manner in the early 1980s, it was accompanied by fear, denial, misunderstanding, social stigma, and a paucity of available support services. The U.S. Army was becoming increasingly aware of the potential impact HIV could have on the active forces. A tragic event involving the suicide of a young HIV-infected soldier resulted in the development of a comprehensive medical/psychosocial assessment and treatment program for HIV-infected service members and their families at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Social work services played an integral role in the development of this program as this profession has done historically in meeting other emerging needs of the military. Special attention is given to the unique psychosocial issues and needs of the HIV-infected service member and the comprehensive and compassionate response of the military medical team with its significant social work contribution."

"%X Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to the increased rates of suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder in military personnel and veterans, and it is also associated with the risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. A cross-phenotype high-resolution polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PCS) was conducted in 845 U.S. Army soldiers who sustained TBI during their deployment. We used a prospective longitudinal survey of three brigade combat teams to assess deployment-acquired TBI and persistent physical, cognitive, and emotional PCS. PRS was derived from summary statistics of large genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (MDD); and for years of schooling, college completion, childhood intelligence, infant head circumference (IHC), and adult intracranial volume. Although our study had more than 95% of statistical power to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes, no association was observed with neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, suggesting that persistent PCS does not share genetic components with these traits to a moderate-to-large degree. We observed a significant finding: subjects with high IHC PRS recovered better from cognitive/emotional persistent PCS than the other individuals (R"

Descriptive statistics were collected, and regression analyses comparing the groups were conducted.|Thirty-seven percent of marines and 40% of Army soldiers reported that they could use more suicide prevention training. Compared with trained civilians, NCOs reported greater efficacy to intervene with at-risk peers, but they also reported relatively more reluctance to intervene. Close to 40% of NCOs believed that they would be held responsible for a service member's suicide if they had asked the service member about suicidal thoughts before the suicide occurred. Chaplains were the preferred referral source, primarily because of the confidentiality they afford.|Suicide prevention training for NCOs should focus on strategies for asking about suicide risk, assuring soldiers and marines that they will not be blamed for the suicides of fellow service members, and encouraging referrals. These results can help improve suicide prevention programs in the Army and Marine Corps, including whether current policies may need to be changed to optimize NCOs' ability to identify, intervene on behalf of, and refer service members at risk of suicide."

"%X Over the past decade, the U.S. Army has invested significant resources in its efforts to prevent suicide and respond to a well-documented increase in suicides among active-duty soldiers. Among the efforts under way is a program to develop an information system that provides leaders with data on individual- and unit-level suicide risk factors and could serve as the basis for prevention and intervention activities. One shortfall of this approach is the lack of guidance on how Army leaders should interpret and use this information. To address this gap, RAND Arroyo Center convened a group of experts to reach consensus on recommended actions for leaders who are informed that an individual soldier exhibits a risk factor for suicide or that their unit exhibits an atypically high prevalence of suicide risk factors or a concerning trend of suicidality. The experts generally agreed that information on suicide risk indicators could be useful to unit leaders if they also received guidance on appropriate actions from behavioral health providers-and central to any response is the need to keep information about individual soldiers confidential. At the unit level, data on atypically high-risk behaviors should prompt a ""root cause"" analysis to discern whether the heightened prevalence is a reflection of actual behaviors or can be explained by other factors. The experts concluded that unit-level suicide trend data have limited utility for leader action because suicide is a relatively rare event and because individuals assigned to a unit change over time. The results of the exercise led to several recommendations on the use of data in response planning for Army leaders and directions for future research."

"%X Suicide rates have risen considerably in the United States Army in the past decade. Suicide risk is highest among those with past suicidality (suicidal ideation or attempts). The incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive illnesses has risen concurrently in the U.S. Army. We examined the relationship of PTSD and depression, independently and in combination, and rates of past-year suicidality in a representative sample of U.S. Army soldiers.|This study used the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel (DoD HRB) (N=5927). Probable PTSD and depression were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Past-year suicidality was assessed via self-report.|Six percent of Army service members reported suicidality within the past year. PTSD and MDD were each independently associated with past-year suicidality. Soldiers with both disorders were almost three times more likely to report suicidality within the past year than those with either diagnosis alone. Population-attributable risk proportions for PTSD, depression, and both disorders together were 24%, 29%, and 45%, respectively.|The current study is subject to the limitations of a cross-sectional survey design and the self-report nature of the instruments used.|PTSD and depression are each associated with suicidality independently and in combination in the active duty component of the U.S. Army. Soldiers presenting with either but especially both disorders may require additional outreach and screening to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts."

"%X Prior research has shown that a substantial portion of suicide decedents access health care in the weeks and months before their death. We examined whether this is true among soldiers.|The sample included the 569 Regular Army soldiers in the U.S. Army who died by suicide on active duty between 2004 and 2009 compared to 5,690 matched controls. Analyses examined the prevalence and frequency of health care contacts and documentation of suicide risk (i.e., the presence of prior suicidal thoughts and behaviors) over the year preceding suicide death. Predictors of health care contact and suicide risk documentation were also examined.|Approximately 50% of suicide decedents accessed health care in the month prior to their death, and over 25% of suicide decedents accessed health care in the week prior to their death. Mental health encounters were significantly more prevalent among suicide decedents (4 weeks: 27.9% vs. 7.9%, ìà2 = 96.2, p < .001; 52 weeks: 59.4% vs. 33.7%, ìà2 = 120.2, p < .001). Despite this, risk documentation was rare among suicide decedents (4 weeks: 13.8%; 52 weeks: 24.5%). Suicide decedents who were male, never married, and non-Hispanic Black were less likely to access care prior to death. Number of mental health encounters was the only predictor of suicide risk documentation among decedents at 4 weeks (OR = 1.14) and 52 weeks (OR = 1.05) prior to their death.|Many soldiers who die by suicide access health care shortly before death, presenting an opportunity for suicide prevention. However, in most cases, there was no documentation of prior suicidal thoughts or behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in risk detection and prediction. Increasing the frequency, scope, and accuracy of risk assessments, especially in mental health care settings, may be particularly useful. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We report results of efforts to develop models for such targeting from self-report surveys administered at the beginning of Army service.|21 832 new soldiers completed a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) in 2011-2012 and consented to link administrative data to SAQ responses. Penalized regression models were developed for 12 administratively-recorded outcomes occurring by December 2013: suicide attempt, mental hospitalization, positive drug test, traumatic brain injury (TBI), other severe injury, several types of violence perpetration and victimization, demotion, and attrition.|The best-performing models were for TBI (AUC = 0.80), major physical violence perpetration (AUC = 0.78), sexual assault perpetration (AUC = 0.78), and suicide attempt (AUC = 0.74).

"%X To examine associations of administratively recorded sexual assault victimization during military service with subsequent mental health and negative career outcomes among US Army women controlling for nonrandom victimization exposure.|We used data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers to apply propensity score methods to match all 4238 female Regular Army soldiers with administratively recorded sexual assault victimization during 2004 to 2009 to 5 controls per case with similar composite victimization risk. We examined associations of this victimization measure with administratively recorded mental health treatment, suicide attempt, and Army career outcomes over the subsequent 12 months by using survival analysis for dichotomous outcomes and conditional generalized linear models for continuous outcomes.|Women with administratively recorded sexual assault had significantly elevated odds ratios (ORs) of subsequent mental health treatment (any, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.4, 2.6; specialty, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä3.1; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.9, 3.3; inpatient, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.8; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.5, 3.1), posttraumatic stress disorder treatment (any, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä6.3; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä5.7, 6.9; specialty, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä7.7; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä6.8, 8.6; inpatient, OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä6.8; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä5.4, 8.6), suicide attempt (OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä3.0; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.5, 3.6), demotion (OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä2.1; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.9, 2.3), and attrition (OR‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.2; 95% CI‰Ûä=‰Ûä1.1, 1.2).|Sexual assault victimization is associated with considerable suffering and likely decreased force readiness."

"%X This study examined the short-term effects of a brief crisis intervention on optimism of acutely suicidal soldiers.|U.S. Soldiers (N‰Ûä=‰Ûä97) presenting for an emergency mental health appointment in a military emergency department or behavioural health clinic were randomly assigned to treatment as usual standard crisis response plan, or enhanced crisis response plan (E-CRP). This study is used a subsample of the original clinical trial (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä64) for those who completed self-report measures of optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised) prior to receiving any intervention and a secondary self-report assessment one-month following the intervention.|Results indicate that individuals with low baseline optimism who received the E-CRP had significant increases in optimism 1‰Ûämonth post-intervention.|This provides evidence that discussing a patient's reasons for living during a CRP increases optimism in those high-risk patients with the lowest baseline optimism."

"%X Although the interpersonal theory of suicide may explain the elevated suicide risk among military service members, past explorations have been equivocal. This study aimed to investigate the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a sample of U.S. Army recruiters.|Participants (N = 3,428) completed self-report measures assessing the interpersonal theory's constructs (i.e., thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), acquired capability for suicide), current suicidal ideation, agitation, and insomnia. History of depression was obtained from medical records.|Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the interaction between TB and PB was associated with current suicidal ideation, controlling for depression, agitation, and insomnia. This effect was especially notable among those with high capability for suicide.|Findings provide support for the interpersonal theory in a large, diverse military sample. It may be advantageous to assess and therapeutically address TB and PB among at-risk service members."

A first triage was carried out by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was carried out with systematic ultrasound exam.

It has been referred to as ""The Main Gate Syndrome."" We introduced the novel concept of a semi-evacuation hospital or receiving center where a second surgical triage was carried out. These exceptional circumstances require open-minded flexibility, a tailored approach, and close cooperation between surgeons and anesthetists to share experience, opinions, and ideas. In the setting of mass casualties, emergency ultrasound exam was shown to be a valuable and effective tool by virtue of its mobility, reproducibility, and immediate results."

"%X Soldiers in the U.S. Army National Guard are at elevated risk for suicide compared to soldiers in the other components. Most suicides by military service members, including members of the U.S. Army National Guard, are enacted with personal firearms. The unsafe storage of firearms is associated with increased risk for death by suicide. Therefore, efforts to elucidate modifiable factors associated with unsafe firearm storage have the potential to inform military suicide prevention efforts. PTSD hyperarousal symptoms are characterized in part by a heightened sense of being ""on guard"" for potential dangers and might contribute to an increased likelihood of storing firearms unsafely. This study sought to examine if more severe PTSD hyperarousal symptoms are associated with greater unsafe firearm storage practices.

"%X Understanding suicide risk is a priority for the US military. We aimed to estimate associations of childhood maltreatment with pre-enlistment suicidal behaviors in new Army soldiers.|Cross-sectional survey data from 38,237 soldiers reporting for basic training from April 2011 through November 2012 were analyzed. Scales assessing retrospectively reported childhood abuse and neglect were derived and subjected to latent class analysis, which yielded 5 profiles: No Maltreatment, Episodic Emotional Maltreatment, Frequent Emotional/Physical Maltreatment, Episodic Emotional/Sexual Abuse, and Frequent Emotional/Physical/Sexual Maltreatment. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to estimate associations of maltreatment profiles with suicidal behaviors (assessed with a modified Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale), adjusting for sociodemographics and mental disorders.|Nearly 1 in 5 new soldiers was classified as experiencing childhood maltreatment. Relative to No Maltreatment, all multivariate maltreatment profiles were associated (P values < .001) with elevated odds of lifetime suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 3.10-4.93), plan (AORs = 3.75-10.77), attempt (AORs = 3.60-15.95), and onset of plan among those with ideation (AORs = 1.40-3.10). Several profiles also predicted attempts among those with plans (AORs = 2.01-2.47), and Frequent Emotional/Physical/Sexual Maltreatment predicted unplanned attempts among ideators (AOR = 5.32). Adjustment for mental disorders attenuated but did not eliminate these associations.|Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with suicidal behavior among new soldiers, even after adjusting for intervening mental disorders. Among soldiers with lifetime ideation, certain maltreatment profiles are associated with elevated odds of subsequently planning and/or attempting suicide. Focus on childhood maltreatment might reveal avenues for risk reduction among new soldiers."

"%X The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) has found that the proportional elevation in the US Army enlisted soldier suicide rate during deployment (compared with the never-deployed or previously deployed) is significantly higher among women than men, raising the possibility of gender differences in the adverse psychological effects of deployment.|Person-month survival models based on a consolidated administrative database for active duty enlisted Regular Army soldiers in 2004-2009 (n = 975,057) were used to characterize the gender ÌÑ deployment interaction predicting suicide. Four explanatory hypotheses were explored involving the proportion of females in each soldier's occupation, the proportion of same-gender soldiers in each soldier's unit, whether the soldier reported sexual assault victimization in the previous 12 months, and the soldier's pre-deployment history of treated mental/behavioral disorders.|The suicide rate of currently deployed women (14.0/100,000 person-years) was 3.1-3.5 times the rates of other (i.e. never-deployed/previously deployed) women. The suicide rate of currently deployed men (22.6/100,000 person-years) was 0.9-1.2 times the rates of other men. The adjusted (for time trends, sociodemographics, and Army career variables) female:male odds ratio comparing the suicide rates of currently deployed v. other women v. men was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.8), became 2.4 after excluding soldiers with Direct Combat Arms occupations, and remained elevated (in the range 1.9-2.8) after adjusting for the hypothesized explanatory variables.|These results are valuable in excluding otherwise plausible hypotheses for the elevated suicide rate of deployed women and point to the importance of expanding future research on the psychological challenges of deployment for women."

"%X The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) has found that the proportional elevation in the US Army enlisted soldier suicide rate during deployment (compared with the never-deployed or previously deployed) is significantly higher among women than men, raising the possibility of gender differences in the adverse psychological effects of deployment.|Person-month survival models based on a consolidated administrative database for active duty enlisted Regular Army soldiers in 2004-2009 (n = 975,057) were used to characterize the gender ÌÑ deployment interaction predicting suicide. Four explanatory hypotheses were explored involving the proportion of females in each soldier's occupation, the proportion of same-gender soldiers in each soldier's unit, whether the soldier reported sexual assault victimization in the previous 12 months, and the soldier's pre-deployment history of treated mental/behavioral disorders.|The suicide rate of currently deployed women (14.0/100,000 person-years) was 3.1-3.5 times the rates of other (i.e. never-deployed/previously deployed) women. The suicide rate of currently deployed men (22.6/100,000 person-years) was 0.9-1.2 times the rates of other men. The adjusted (for time trends, sociodemographics, and Army career variables) female:male odds ratio comparing the suicide rates of currently deployed v. other women v. men was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.8), became 2.4 after excluding soldiers with Direct Combat Arms occupations, and remained elevated (in the range 1.9-2.8) after adjusting for the hypothesized explanatory variables.|These results are valuable in excluding otherwise plausible hypotheses for the elevated suicide rate of deployed women and point to the importance of expanding future research on the psychological challenges of deployment for women."

Studying these characteristics together and prospectively within a population confronted with high stressor exposure (e.g. U.S. Army soldiers) has not been done, yet could uncover unique and interactive predictive effects that may inform prevention and early intervention efforts.|Five broad personality traits and social network size were assessed via self-administered questionnaires among experienced soldiers preparing for deployment (|Among the personality traits, elevated neuroticism was consistently associated with increased mental health risk following deployment. Small social networks were also associated with increased mental health risk following deployment, beyond the variance accounted for by personality. Limited support was found for social network size moderating the association between personality and mental health outcomes. Small social networks also predicted distress disorders and suicidal behavior 5 years following enlistment, whereas unique effects of personality traits on these more distal outcomes were rare.|Heightened neuroticism and small social networks predict a greater risk for negative mental health sequelae, especially following deployment.

"%X Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) prospectively predicts suicidal thoughts and behaviors in civilian populations. Despite high rates of suicide among US military members, little is known about the prevalence and course of NSSI, or how NSSI relates to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, in military personnel.|We conducted secondary analyses of two representative surveys of active-duty soldiers (N = 21 449) and newly enlisted soldiers (N = 38 507) from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS).|The lifetime prevalence of NSSI is 6.3% (1.2% 12-month prevalence) in active-duty soldiers and 7.9% (1.3% 12-month prevalence) in new soldiers. Demographic risk factors for lifetime NSSI include female sex, younger age, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, never having married, and lower educational attainment. The association of NSSI with temporally primary internalizing and externalizing disorders varies by service history (new v. active-duty soldiers) and gender (men v. women). In both active-duty and new soldiers, NSSI is associated with increased odds of subsequent onset of suicidal ideation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.66-1.81] and suicide attempts (adjusted OR = 2.02-2.43), although not with the transition from ideation to attempt (adjusted OR = 0.92-1.36). Soldiers with a history of NSSI are more likely to have made multiple suicide attempts, compared with soldiers without NSSI.|NSSI is prevalent among US Army soldiers and is associated with significantly increased odds of later suicidal thoughts and behaviors, even after NSSI has resolved. Suicide risk assessments in military populations should screen for history of NSSI."

"%X IMPORTANCE/OBJECTIVE: Although the suicide rate in the U.S. Army has traditionally been below age-gender matched civilian rates, it has climbed steadily since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and since 2008 has exceeded the demographically matched civilian rate. The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) is a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study designed to generate actionable evidence-based recommendations to reduce Army suicides and increase knowledge about risk and resilience factors for suicidality and its psychopathological correlates. This paper presents an overview of the Army STARRS component study designs and of recent findings. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION: Army STARRS includes six main component studies: (1) the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative data systems (including records of suicidal behaviors) for all soldiers on active duty 2004-2009 aimed at finding administrative record predictors of suicides; (2) retrospective case-control studies of fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors (each planned to have n = 150 cases and n = 300 controls); (3) a study of new soldiers (n = 50,765 completed surveys) assessed just before beginning basic combat training (BCT) with self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), neurocognitive tests, and blood samples; (4) a cross-sectional study of approximately 35,000 (completed SAQs) soldiers representative of all other (i.e., exclusive of BCT) active duty soldiers; (5) a pre-post deployment study (with blood samples) of soldiers in brigade combat teams about to deploy to Afghanistan (n = 9,421 completed baseline surveys), with sub-samples assessed again one, three, and nine months after returning from deployment; and (6) a pilot study to follow-up SAQ respondents transitioning to civilian life. Army/DoD administrative data are being linked prospectively to the large-scale survey samples to examine predictors of subsequent suicidality and related mental health outcomes.|Measures (self-report and administratively recorded) of suicidal behaviors and their psychopathological correlates.|Component study cooperation rates are comparatively high. Sample biases are relatively small. Inefficiencies introduced into parameter estimates by using nonresponse adjustment weights and time-space clustering are small. Initial findings show that the suicide death rate, which rose over 2004-2009, increased for those deployed, those never deployed, and those previously deployed. Analyses of administrative records show that those deployed or previously deployed were at greater suicide risk. Receiving a waiver to enter the Army was not associated with increased risk. However, being demoted in the past two years was associated with increased risk. Time in current deployment, length of time since return from most recent deployment, total number of deployments, and time interval between most recent deployments (known as dwell time) were not associated with suicide risk. Initial analyses of survey data show that 13.9% of currently active non-deployed regular Army soldiers considered suicide at some point in their lifetime, while 5.3% had made a suicide plan, and 2.4% had attempted suicide. Importantly, 47-60% of these outcomes first occurred prior to enlistment. Prior mental disorders, in particular major depression and intermittent explosive disorder, were the strongest predictors of these self-reported suicidal behaviors. Most onsets of plans-attempts among ideators (58.3-63.3%) occurred within the year of onset of ideation. About 25.1% of non-deployed U.S. Army personnel met 30-day criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior, or substance disorder (15.0% an internalizing disorder; 18.4% an externalizing disorder) and 11.1% for multiple disorders. Importantly, three-fourths of these disorders had pre-enlistment onsets.|Integration across component studies creates strengths going well beyond those in conventional applications of the same individual study designs. These design features create a strong methodological foundation from which Army STARRS can pursue its substantive research goals. The early findings reported here illustrate the importance of the study and its approach as a model of studying rare events particularly of national security concern. Continuing analyses of the data will inform suicide prevention for the U.S. Army."

"%X Although the U.S. Army suicide rate is known to have risen sharply over the past decade, information about medically documented, nonfatal suicidal behaviors is far more limited. Here we examine trends and sociodemographic correlates of suicide attempts, suspicious injuries, and suicide ideation among regular Army soldiers.|Data come from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS), which integrates administrative records for all soldiers on active duty during the years 2004 through 2009 (n = 1.66 million).|We identified 21,740 unique regular Army soldiers with a nonfatal suicidal event documented at some point during the HADS study period. There were substantial increases in the annual incidence rates of suicide attempts (179-400/100,000 person-years) and suicide ideation (557-830/100,000 person-years), but not suspicious injuries. Using hierarchical classification rules to identify the first instance of each soldier's most severe behavior, we found increased risk of all outcomes among those who were female, non-Hispanic White, never married, lower-ranking enlisted, less educated, and of younger age when entering Army service. These sociodemographic associations significantly differed across outcomes, despite some patterns that appear similar.|Results provide a broad overview of nonfatal suicidal trends in the U.S. Army during 2004 through 2009 and demonstrate that integration of multiple administrative data systems enriches analysis of the predictors of such events."

"%X There has been limited systematic examination of whether risk of suicide attempt (SA) among US Army soldiers is associated with time-related deployment variables, such as time in service before first deployment, duration of first deployment, and dwell time (DT) (ie, length of time between deployments).|To examine the associations of time-related deployment variables with subsequent SA among soldiers who had deployed twice.|Using administrative data from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2009, this longitudinal, retrospective cohort study identified person-month records of active-duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had served continuously in the US Army for at least 2 years and deployed exactly twice. The dates of analysis were March 1 to December 1, 2017. There were 593 soldiers with a medically documented SA during or after their second deployment. An equal-probability sample of control person-months was selected from other soldiers with exactly 2 deployments (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä19‰Ûø034). Logistic regression analyses examined the associations of time in service before first deployment, duration of first deployment, and DT with subsequent SA.|Suicide attempts during or after second deployment were identified using US Department of Defense Suicide Event Report records and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification E950 to E958 diagnostic codes. Independent variables were constructed from US Army personnel records.|Among 593 SA cases, most were male (513 [86.5%]), white non-Hispanic (392 [66.1%]), at least high school educated (477 [80.4%]), currently married (398 [67.1%]), and younger than 21 years when they entered the US Army (384 [64.8%]). In multivariable models adjusting for sociodemographics, service-related characteristics, and previous mental health diagnosis, odds of SA during or after second deployment were higher among soldiers whose first deployment occurred within the first 12 months of service vs after 12 months (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.4) and among those with a DT of 6 months or less vs longer than 6 months (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0). Duration of first deployment was not associated with subsequent SA. Analysis of 2-way interactions indicated that the associations of early deployment and DT with SA risk were not modified by other characteristics. Multivariable population-attributable risk proportions were 14.2% for deployment within the first 12 months of service and 4.0% for DT of 6 months or less.|Time in service before first deployment and DT are modifiable risk factors for SA risk among soldiers."

The odds of suicide attempt among soldiers in a unit with 5 or more past-year attempts was more than twice that of soldiers in a unit with no previous attempts (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.1-2.6). The association of previous unit suicide attempts with subsequent risk was significant whether soldiers had a combat arms MOS or other MOS (ORs, 1.4-2.3; P‰Ûä<‰Ûä.001) and regardless of unit size, with the highest risk among those in smaller units (1-40 soldiers) (ORs, 2.1-5.9; P‰Ûä<‰Ûä.001).

Logistic regression analyses examined soldiers' risk of attempting suicide as a function of monthly IED frequency, controlling for sociodemographics, service-related characteristics, rate of deployment/redeployment, and combat deaths and injuries. The association of IED frequency with suicide attempt was examined overall and by time in service and deployment status.|Soldiers' risk of suicide attempt increased with increasing numbers of IEDs. Suicide attempt was 26% more likely for each 1,000 IED increase in monthly frequency (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.30). The association of IED frequency with suicide attempt was greater for soldiers in their first 2 years of service (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.25-1.36) than for those with 3 or more years of service (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.12-1.24).

This association was observed across deployment status and time in service, and for early-career soldiers in particular. The findings suggest that the threat of new weapons may increase stress burden among soldiers. Targeting risk perception and perceived preparedness, particularly early in a soldier's career, may improve psychological resilience and reduce suicide risk."

Risk may vary according to occupation, which significantly influences the stressors that soldiers experience.|Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), we identified person-month records for all active duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had a medically documented suicide attempt from 2004 through 2009 (nåÊ=åÊ9650) and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (nåÊ=åÊ153,528). Logistic regression analyses examined the association of combat occupation (combat arms [CA], special forces [SF], combat medic [CM]) with suicide attempt, adjusting for socio-demographics, service-related characteristics, and prior mental health diagnosis.|In adjusted models, the odds of attempting suicide were higher in CA (ORåÊ=åÊ1.2 [95% CI: 1.1-1.2]) and CM (ORåÊ=åÊ1.4 [95% CI: 1.3-1.5]), but lower in SF (ORåÊ=åÊ0.3 [95% CI: 0.2-0.5]) compared to all other occupations. CA and CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than other occupations if never deployed (ORsåÊ=åÊ1.1-1.5) or previously deployed (ORsåÊ=åÊ1.2-1.3), but not when currently deployed. Occupation was associated with suicide attempt in the first ten years of service, but not beyond. In the first year of service, primarily a time of training, CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than both CA (ORåÊ=åÊ1.4 [95% CI: 1.2-1.6]) and other occupations (ORåÊ=åÊ1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.7]). Discrete-time hazard functions revealed that these occupations had distinct patterns of monthly risk during the first year of service.|Military occupation can inform the understanding suicide attempt risk among soldiers."

"%X The U.S. Army suicide attempt rate increased sharply during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Risk may vary according to occupation, which significantly influences the stressors that soldiers experience.|Using administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), we identified person-month records for all active duty Regular Army enlisted soldiers who had a medically documented suicide attempt from 2004 through 2009 (nåÊ=åÊ9650) and an equal-probability sample of control person-months (nåÊ=åÊ153,528). Logistic regression analyses examined the association of combat occupation (combat arms [CA], special forces [SF], combat medic [CM]) with suicide attempt, adjusting for socio-demographics, service-related characteristics, and prior mental health diagnosis.|In adjusted models, the odds of attempting suicide were higher in CA (ORåÊ=åÊ1.2 [95% CI: 1.1-1.2]) and CM (ORåÊ=åÊ1.4 [95% CI: 1.3-1.5]), but lower in SF (ORåÊ=åÊ0.3 [95% CI: 0.2-0.5]) compared to all other occupations. CA and CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than other occupations if never deployed (ORsåÊ=åÊ1.1-1.5) or previously deployed (ORsåÊ=åÊ1.2-1.3), but not when currently deployed. Occupation was associated with suicide attempt in the first ten years of service, but not beyond. In the first year of service, primarily a time of training, CM had higher odds of suicide attempt than both CA (ORåÊ=åÊ1.4 [95% CI: 1.2-1.6]) and other occupations (ORåÊ=åÊ1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.7]). Discrete-time hazard functions revealed that these occupations had distinct patterns of monthly risk during the first year of service.|Military occupation can inform the understanding suicide attempt risk among soldiers."

Understanding the association between suicide attempts and deployment, as well as method and timing of suicide attempts, can assist in developing interventions.|To examine suicide attempt risk factors, methods, and timing among soldiers currently deployed, previously deployed, and never deployed at the time this study was conducted.|This longitudinal, retrospective cohort study of Regular Army-enlisted soldiers on active duty from 2004 through 2009 used individual-level person-month records to examine risk factors (sociodemographic, service related, and mental health), method, and time of suicide attempt by deployment status (never, currently, and previously deployed). Administrative data for the month before each of 9650 incident suicide attempts and an equal-probability sample of 153‰Ûø528 control person-months for other soldiers were analyzed using a discrete-time survival framework.|Suicide attempts and career, mental health, and demographic predictors were obtained from administrative and medical records.|Of the 9650 enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide, 86.3% were male, 68.4% were younger than 30 years, 59.8% were non-Hispanic white, 76.5% were high school educated, and 54.7% were currently married. The 40.4% of enlisted soldiers who had never been deployed (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä12‰Ûø421‰Ûø294 person-months) accounted for 61.1% of enlisted soldiers who attempted suicide (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä5894 cases). Risk among those never deployed was highest in the second month of service (103 per 100‰Ûø000 person-months). Risk among soldiers on their first deployment was highest in the sixth month of deployment (25 per 100‰Ûø000 person-months). For those previously deployed, risk was highest at 5 months after return (40 per 100‰Ûø000 person-months). Currently and previously deployed soldiers were more likely to attempt suicide with a firearm than those never deployed (currently deployed: OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.9-5.6; previously deployed: OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9). Across deployment status, suicide attempts were more likely among soldiers who were women (currently deployed: OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0-4.0; previously deployed: OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.7; and never deployed: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.3-2.6), in their first 2 years of service (currently deployed: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.3; previously deployed: OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9-2.7; and never deployed: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.7-3.6), and had a recently received a mental health diagnosis in the previous month (currently deployed: OR, 29.8; 95% CI, 25.0-35.5; previously deployed: OR, 22.2; 95% CI, 20.1-24.4; and never deployed: OR, 15.0; 95% CI, 14.2-16.0). Among soldiers with 1 previous deployment, odds of a suicide attempt were higher for those who screened positive for depression or posttraumatic stress disorder after return from deployment and particularly at follow-up screening, about 4 to 6 months after deployment (depression: OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; posttraumatic stress disorder: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8).|Identifying the timing and risk factors for suicide attempt in soldiers requires consideration of environmental context, individual characteristics, and mental health.

"%X The U.S. Army suicide rate increased sharply during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is limited information about medically documented, nonfatal suicidal behaviors among soldiers in the Army's Reserve Component (RC), which is composed of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Here we examine trends and sociodemographic correlates of suicide attempts, suspicious injuries, and suicide ideation among activated RC soldiers.|Data come from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS), which integrates administrative records for all soldiers on active duty for the years 2004 through 2009 (nåÊ=åÊ1.66 million).|We identified 2,937 unique RC soldiers on active duty with a nonfatal suicidal event documented at some point during the HADS study period. There were increases in the annual incidence rates of suicide attempts (71 to 204/100,000 person-years) and suicide ideation (326 to 425/100,000 person-years). Incidence rates for suspicious injuries also generally increased but were more variable. Using hierarchical classification rules, we identified the first instance of each soldier's most severe behavior (suicide attempt versus suspicious injury versus suicide ideation). For each of those suicide- or injury-related outcomes, we found increased risk among those who were female, younger, non-Hispanic White, less educated, never married, and lower-ranking enlisted. These sociodemographic associations significantly differed across outcomes, although the patterns were similar.|Results provide a broad overview of nonfatal suicidal trends in the RC during the period 2004 through 2009. They also demonstrate that integration of multiple administrative data systems enriches analysis of the predictors of such events."

"%X Among U.S. Army soldiers suicide attempts (SAs) are a significant public health concern, particularly early in service. We examined the association of attachment style with SA and suicide ideation (SI) among U.S. Army soldiers.|We analyzed survey data from new soldiers who participated in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). The sample consists of 38,507 soldiers entering Basic Combat Training (BCT) between April 2011 and November 2012. Attachment style (secure, preoccupied, fearful, and dismissing) was assessed using items from the Relationship Questionnaire. Lifetime (pre-enlistment) SA and SI were assessed with a modified Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Logistic regression analyses examined associations of attachment style with lifetime SA, SI, and attempts among ideators, after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics.|The secure attachment style was associated with lower odds of SA (ORåÊ=åÊ0.76, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ0.63-0.92), whereas preoccupied (ORåÊ=åÊ4.63, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ3.83-5.61), fearful (ORåÊ=åÊ4.08, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ3.38-4.94), or dismissing (ORåÊ=åÊ1.56, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ1.24-1.96) attachment styles were associated with higher odds of SA. Similar results were found for SI. Importantly, both preoccupied (ORåÊ=åÊ1.67, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ1.37-2.04) and fearful (ORåÊ=åÊ1.70, 95% CIåÊ=åÊ1.38-2.08) attachment were associated with attempts among ideators.|These findings highlight the clinical importance of attachment style in predicting suicidal behavior and as possible targets for intervention. A critical next step is for prospective research to examine whether attachment style predicts future suicidal behavior."

"%X Suicide and suicide attempts among U.S. Army soldiers are a significant concern for public health. This study examined the association of parental suicide attempt prior to age 13 of the soldier with subsequent risk of pre-enlistment suicide attempt.|We conducted secondary analyses of survey data from new soldiers who participated in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) (NåÊ=åÊ38,396). A series of logistic regression analyses were conducted.|Of all new soldiers, 1.4% reported that they attempted suicide between age 13 and entering the Army, and 2.3% reported a parental suicide attempt prior to age 13. Parental suicide attempt was associated with increased odds of subsequent suicide attempt; however, this association was moderated by gender and was significant only among male soldiers. The association between parental suicide attempt and pre-enlistment suicide attempt among male soldiers was still significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, soldier/parental psychopathology, and childhood adversities.|These results highlight parental suicide attempt as a unique pre-enlistment risk factor for suicide attempt, especially among male new soldiers. Further studies are needed to separate the genetic and environmental contributions to intra-familial risk for suicidal behavior."

"%X The choice of the standard population is important when calculating adjusted rates for a military population: results can influence policies and funding allocations for programs and initiatives for suicide prevention. We describe the methodological considerations and decision-making process used in choosing a standard population for adjusting rates to compare suicide among US Army soldiers and the general US population. We examined 5 different standard populations, using the direct method to adjust annual suicide rates for the Army and the US population, 2004 to 2015, for age and for age and sex. The pattern of the Army and US population age- and sex-adjusted rates remained consistent with crude rates when adjusted to any of the Army standard population distributions. Using an Army distribution as the standard population produces suicide rates consistent with routine messaging about suicide trends among Army soldiers."

"%X Suicide is the leading cause of death in most armies during peace-time. The recent dramatic rise in suicides in the US Army further focuses attention on the causes of suicidal behavior in the military.|This study investigated demographic characteristics, psychological profile and stress-related risk factors associated with suicide attempts in Israelis aged 18-21 years, who served in the Army in 2009. Soldiers who attempted suicide (N=60) were compared to soldiers treated by a mental health professional, but reported no suicidal behavior (N=58), and to controls (N=50).|Suicide attempters had lower socioeconomic status and less cognitive ability compared with treated soldiers and untreated control soldiers. Only 25% of the suicide attempters had received mental healthcare prior to the attempt. The majority of the attempts were non-lethal (86.2%), and only 5.2% used firearms. Attempters had more previous suicide attempts (37.9%) and deliberate selfharm incidents (19.3%), compared to almost no such behaviors in the other two groups. Following the suicide attempt, 77% were diagnosed with moderate to severe mental disorders, 44.8% personality disorders and 8.6% mood disorders. Attempters reported higher levels of general stress compared to their peers in the other two groups. Being away from home and obeying authority were especially more stressful in attempters.|Young soldiers are less prone to seek mental health assistance, despite suffering from higher levels of stress.

"%X Suicide is one of the ten leading causes of death in United States and the suicide rate in the military population has increased since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. However, few biomarkers for current suicidal ideation (CSI) have been identified. The current study examined the association of four candidate genes with CSI in active duty US Army Special Operations Command and National Guard units (n‰Ûø=‰Ûø3,889) who served in Iraq and Afghanistan between November 2009 and July 2014.|Current PTSD symptoms and CSI were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and PHQ-9, respectively. Traumatic events were assessed using items from the Life Events Checklist (LEC) that met the DSM-IV PTSD criteria of a traumatic stressor. All genotypes of saliva DNA were discriminated using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease assay.|The associations between CSI and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), FK506 binding protein (FKBP5), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), or S100A10 (p11) were examined. We found CSI was associated with BDNF (OR‰Ûø=‰Ûø1.5, 95% CI‰Ûø=‰Ûø1.5-1.8, P‰Ûø=‰Ûø0.0002), but not FKBP5, COMT and p11. Female soldiers reported CSI more often than males (ìà2‰Ûø=‰Ûø7.403, p‰Ûø=‰Ûø0.0065), although gender did not affect CSI severity. In addition, associations were found between CSI and depression, PTSD, and BDNF, but not traumatic events. The BDNF Val66Met contributed to the severity of CSI even after adjusting to PTSD, depression and LEC.|The associations of BDNF with CSI and its severity suggest that BDNF may be a predictor of suicidal risk and present an opportunity to develop laboratory tools with clinical implications in suicide prevention and treatment."

"%X Deployment-related experiences might be risk factors for soldier suicides, in which case identification of vulnerable soldiers before deployment could inform preventive efforts. We investigated this possibility by using pre-deployment survey and administrative data in a sample of US Army soldiers to develop a risk model for suicide attempt (SA) during and shortly after deployment.|Data came from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers Pre-Post Deployment Survey (PPDS). Soldiers completed a baseline survey shortly before deploying to Afghanistan in 2011-2012. Survey measures were used to predict SAs, defined using administrative and subsequent survey data, through 30 months after deployment. Models were built using penalized regression and ensemble machine learning methods.|Significant pre-deployment risk factors were history of traumatic brain injury, 9åÊ+åÊmental health treatment visits in the 12 months before deployment, young age, female, previously married, and low relationship quality. Cross-validated AUC of the best penalized and ensemble models were .75-.77. 21.3-40.4% of SAs occurred among the 5-10% of soldiers with highest predicted risk and positive predictive value (PPV) among these high-risk soldiers was 4.4-5.7%.|SA can be predicted significantly from pre-deployment data, but intervention planning needs to take PPV into consideration."
