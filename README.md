# lit-review

### Project type: 
Literature review

### Problem set: 
There are over 20,000 peer-reviewed journal article titles for review. Not all teammates have access to reference management software. The project team is using a shared excel file to conduct a title review, an abstract review, and a full review. Instead of manually pulling each PubMed file and enter publication year, title, PMID, etc. to an excel, I thought we could use R to shorten the process to create a lit review database.

### Purpose: 
Use R to extract infomration from PubMed (exporting using EndNote format) and create a user friendly database for lit review.

### Demo files in this folder:
I used 149 articles to demonstrate how a lit review database can be created.
